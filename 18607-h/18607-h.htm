<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<h3>CLASSIFICATION AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF MANÓBOS<br> AND OTHER
PEOPLES IN EASTERN MINDANÁO</h3>

<a name="111"></a>
<h4>EXPLANATION OF TERMS</h4>

<a name="1111"></a>
<h5>"EASTERN MINDANÁO"</h5>
</center>

<p>Throughout this monograph I have used the term &#34;eastern
Mindanáo&#34; to include that part of Mindanáo that is east of the
central Cordillera as far south as the headwaters of the River
Libagánon, east of the River Tágum and its influent the Libagánon, and
east of the gulf of Davao.</p>

<center>
<a name="1112"></a>
<h5>THE TERM &#34;TRIBE&#34;</h5>
</center>

<p>The word &#34;tribe&#34; is used in the sense in which Dean C.
Worcester defines and uses it in his article on The non-Christian Tribes
of Northern Luzon:<sup>1</sup></p>

<blockquote><p>A division of a race composed of an aggregate of
individuals of a kind and of a common origin, agreeing among themselves
in, and distinguished from their congeners by physical characteristics,
dress, and ornaments; the nature of the communities which they form;
peculiarities of house architecture; methods of hunting, fishing, and
carrying on agriculture; character and importance of manufacture;
practices relative to war and the taking of heads of enemies; arms used
in warfare; music and dancing, and marriage and burial customs; but not
constituting a political unit subject to the control of any single
individual nor necessarily speaking the same dialect.</p></blockquote>

<p><sup>1</sup>Philip. Journ. Sci., 1: 803, 1906.</p>

<a name="1113"></a>
<h5>PRESENT USE OF THE WORD &#34;MANÓBO&#34;</h5>
</center>

<p>The word &#34;Manóbo&#34; seems to be a generic name for people of
greatly divergent culture, physical type, and language. Thus it is
applied to the people that dwell in the mountains of the lower half of
Point San Agustin as well as to those people whose habitat is on the
southern part of the Sarangani Peninsula. Those, again, that occupy the
<i>hinterland</i> of Tuna Bay<sup>2</sup> come under the same
designation. So it might seem that the word was originally used to
designate the pagan as distinguished from the Mohammedanized people of
Mindanáo, much as the name <i>Harafóras</i> or <i>Alfúros</i> was
applied by the early writers to the pagans to distinguish them from the
Moros.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Tuna Bay is on the southern coast of Mindanáo, about
halfway between Sarangani Bay and Parang Bay.</p>

<p>In the Agúsan Valley the term <i>manóbo</i> is used very frequently
by Christian and by Christianized peoples, and sometimes by pagans
themselves, to denote that the individual in question is still
<i>unbaptized</i>, whether he be tribally a Mandáya, a Mañgguáñgan, or
of some other group. I have been told by Mandáyas on several occasions
that they were still <i>manóbo</i>, that is, still unbaptized.</p>

<p>Then, again, the word is frequently used by those who are really
Manóbos as a term of contempt for their fellow tribesmen who live in
remoter regions and who are not as well off in a worldly or a
culture[sic] way as they are. Thus I have heard Manóbos of the upper
Agúsan refer to their fellow-tribesmen of Libagánon as <i>Manóbos</i>,
with evident contempt in the voice. I asked them what they themselves
were, and in answer was informed that they were <i>Agusánon</i>--that
is, upper Agúsan people--not <i>Manóbos</i>.</p>

<a name="1114"></a>
<h5>THE DERIVATION AND ORIGINAL APPLICATION OF THE WORD
&#34;MANÓBO&#34;</h5>
</center>

<p>One of the earliest references that I find to the Manóbos of the
Agúsan Valley is in the General History of the Discalced Augustinian
Fathers (1661-1699) by Father Pedro de San Francisco de
Assis.<sup>3</sup> The author says that &#34;the mountains of that
territory<sup>4</sup> are inhabited by a nation of Indians, heathens for
the greater part, called Manóbos, a word signifying in that language, as
if we should say here, <i>robust or very numerous people.</i>&#34; I
have so far found no word in the Manóbo dialect that verifies the
correctness of the above statement. It may be said, however, in favor of
this derivation that <i>manúsia</i> is the word for &#34;man&#34; or
&#34;mankind&#34; in the Malay, Moro (Magindanáo), and Tirurái
languages. In Bagóbo, a dialect that shows very close resemblance to
Manóbo, the word <i>Manóbo</i> means &#34;man,&#34; and in Magindanáo
Moro it means &#34;mountain people,&#34;<sup>5</sup> and is applied by
the Moros to all the mountain people of Mindanáo. It might be
maintained, therefore, with some semblance of reason that the word
<i>Manóbo</i> means simply &#34;people.&#34; Some of the early
historians use the words <i>Manóbo</i>, <i>Mansúba</i>, <i>Manúbo</i>.
These three forms indicate the derivation to be from a prefix
<i>man</i>, signifying &#34;people&#34; or &#34;dweller,&#34; and <i>súba</i>, a
river. From the form <i>Manúbo</i>, however, we might conclude that the
word is made up of <i>man</i>(&#34;people&#34;), and
<i>húbo</i>(&#34;naked&#34;), therefore meaning the &#34;naked
people.&#34; The former derivation, however, appears to be more
consonant with the principles upon which Mindanáo tribal names, both
general and local, are formed. Thus <i>Mansáka</i>, <i>Mandáya</i>,
<i>Mañgguáñgan</i> are derived, the first part of each, from <i>man</i>
(&#34;people&#34; or &#34;dwellers&#34;), and the remainder of the
words, respectively, from <i>sáka</i> (&#34;interior&#34;), <i>dáya</i>
(&#34;up the river&#34;), <i>guáñgan</i> (&#34;forest&#34;). These names
then mean &#34;people of the interior,&#34; &#34;people that dwell on
the upper reaches of the river,&#34; and &#34;people that dwell in the
forest.&#34; Other tribal designations of Mindanáo races and tribes are
almost without exception derived from words that denote the relative
geographic position of the tribe in question. The <i>Banuáon</i> and
<i>Mamánua</i> are derived from <i>banuá</i>, the &#34;country,&#34; as
distinguished from settlements near the main or settled part of the
river. The Bukídnon are the mountain people (<i>bukid</i>, mountain);
<i>Súbanun</i>, the river people (<i>súba</i>, river); <i>Tirurái</i>,
the mountain people (<i>túduk</i>, mountain, <i>etéu</i>,
man);<sup>6</sup> <i>Tagakaólo</i>, the people at the very source of a
river (<i>tága</i>, inhabitant, <i>ólo</i>, head or source).</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Blair and Robertson, 41: 153, 1906.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>The author refers to the mountains in the vicinity of
Líano, a town that stood down the river from the present Veruéla and
which was abandoned when the region subsided.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>Fr. Jacinto Juanmarti's Diccionario Moro
Magindanáo-Español (Manila, 1892), 125.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>My authority for this derivation is a work by Dr. T. H.
Pardo de Tavera on The Origin of Philippine Tribal Names.</p>

<p>The derivation of the above tribal designations leads us to the
opinion that the word <i>Manóbo</i> means by derivation a
&#34;river-man,&#34; and not a &#34;naked man.&#34;</p>

<p>A further alternative derivation has been suggested by Dr. N. M.
Saleeby,<sup>7</sup> from the word <i>túbo</i>, &#34;to grow&#34;; the
word <i>Manóbo</i>, according to this derivation, would mean the people
that grew up on the island, that is the original settlers or
autochthons. The word <i>túbo</i>, &#34;to grow,&#34; is not, however, a
Manóbo word, and it is found only in a few Mindanáo dialects.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Origin of Malayan Filipinos, a paper read before the
Philippine Academy, Manila, Nov. 1, 1911.</p>

<p>Father F. Combes, S. J.,<sup>8</sup> says that the owners, that is,
the autochthonic natives of Mindanáo, were called Manóbos and
Mananápes.<sup>9</sup> In a footnote referring to Mananápes, it is
stated, and appears very reasonable and probable, that the
above-mentioned term is not a tribal designation but merely an
appellation of contempt used on account of the low culture possessed by
the autochthons at that time.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Historia de Mindanáo y Jolo (Madrid, 1664). Ed. Retana
(Madrid, 1897).</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>The word <i>mananáp</i> is the word for <i>animal</i>,
<i>beast</i> in the Cebu Bisáya, Bagóbo, Tirurái, and Magindanáo Moro
languages. Among some of the tribes of eastern Mindanáo, the word is
applied to a class of evil forest spirits of apparently indeterminate
character. It is noteworthy that these spirits seem to correspond to the
<i>Manubu</i> spirits of the Súbanuns as described by Mr. Emerson B.
Christie in his Súbanuns of Sindangan Bay (Pub. Bur. Sci., Div. Eth.,
88, 1909).</p>

<p>Hence there seems to be some little ground for supposing that the
word <i>Manóbo</i> was originally applied to all the people that
formerly occupied the coast and that later fled to the interior, and
settled along the rivers, yielding the seashore to the more civilized
invaders.</p>

<p>The following extract from Dr. N. M. Saleeby<sup>10</sup> bears out
the above opinion:</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>The Origin of the Malayan Filipinos, a paper read before
the Philippine Academy on Nov. 1, 1911.</p>

<blockquote><p>The traditions and legends of the primitive tribes of the
Philippine Archipelago show very clearly that they believe that their
forefathers arose in this land and that they have been here ever since
their creation. They further say that the coast tribes and foreigners
came later and fought them and took possession of the land which the
latter occupy at present. When Masha' ika, the earliest recorded
immigrant, reached Súlu Island, the aborigines had already developed to
such a stage of culture as to have large settlements and rajas or
<i>datus</i>.</p>

<p>These aborigines are often referred to in Súlu and Mindanáo as
Manubus, the original inhabitants of Súlu Islands, the Budanuns, were
called Manubus also. So were the forefathers of the Magindanáo Moros.
The most aboriginal hill tribes of Mindanáo, who number about 60,000
souls or more, are called Manubus.</p></blockquote>

<p>[Transcriber's note: Both of the above paragraphs comprise the
quotation.]</p>

<p>The idea that the original owners were called Manóbos is the opinion
of San Antonio also, as expressed in his Cronicas.<sup>11</sup> Such a
supposition might serve also to explain the wide distribution of the
different Manóbo people in Mindanáo, for, besides occupying the regions
above-mentioned, they are found on the main tributaries of the Rio
Grande de Kotabáto--the Batañgan, the Biktósa, the Luan, the Narkanitan,
etc., and especially on the River Pulañgi--on nearly all the influents
of the last-named stream, and on the Hiñgoog River in the Province of
Misamis. As we shall see later on, even in the Agúsan Valley, the
Manóbos were gradually split on the west side of the river by the
ingress, as of some huge wedge, of the Banuáons. Crossing the eastern
Cordillera, a tremendous mass of towering pinnacles--the home of the
Mamánuas--we find Manóbos occupying the upper reaches of the Rivers
Hubo, Marihátag, Kagwáit, Tágo, Tándag, and Kantílan, on the Pacific
coast. I questioned the Manóbos of the rivers Tágo and Hubo as to their
genealogy and former habitat and found that their parents, and even some
of themselves, had lived on the river Kasilaían, but that, owing to the
hostility of the Banuáons, they had fled to the river Wá-Wa. At the time
of the coming of the Catholic missionaries in 1875, these Manóbos made
their way across the lofty eastern Cordillera in an attempt to escape
from the missionary activities. These two migrations are a forcible
example of what may have taken place in the rest of Mindanáo to bring
about such a wide distribution of what was, perhaps, originally one
people. Each migration led to the formation of a new group from which,
as from a new nucleus, a new tribe may have developed in the course of
time.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>See tribal map.</p>

<center>
<a name="1121"></a>
<h5>IN THE AGÚSAN VALLEY</h5>
</center>

<p>The Manóbos occupy the whole Agúsan Valley as far as the town of Buai
on the upper Agúsan <i>with the following exceptions</i>:</p>

<p>1. The upper parts of the rivers Lamiñga, Kandiisan, Hawilian, and
Óhut, and the whole of the river Maásam, together with the mountainous
region beyond the headwaters of these rivers, and probably the territory
beyond in the district of Misamis, as far over as the habitat of the
Bukídnon tribe.<sup>13</sup></p>

<p><sup>13</sup>The reason for the insertion of this last clause is that
the people inhabiting the mountains at the headwaters of the above
rivers have the same physical types, dress, and weapons as the
Bukídnons, if I may judge from my slight acquaintance with the
latter.</p>

<p>2. The towns of Butuán, Talakógon, Bunáwan, Veruéla, and
Prosperidad.</p>

<p>3. The town of Tagusab and the headwaters of the Tutui and
Binuñgñgaan Rivers.</p>

<center>
<a name="1122"></a>
<h5>ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE PACIFIC CORDILLERA</h5>
</center>

<p>In this region I include the upper waters of the Liañga, Hubo,
Oteiza, Marihátag, Kagwáit, Tágo, Tándag, and Kantílan Rivers.</p>

<h5>ON THE PENINSULA OF SAN AGUSTIN</h5>
</center>

<p>I desire to call the reader's attention to the fact that <i>this
monograph has no reference to the Manóbos of Port San Agustin nor to the
Manóbos of the Libagánon River and its tributaries, nor to the Manóbos
that occupy the hinterland above Nasipit as far as the Bugábus
River</i>. I had only cursory dealings with the inhabitants of the
last-named region but both from my own scant observations and from the
reports of others more familiar with them, I am inclined to believe that
there may be differences great enough to distinguish them from the other
peoples of the Agúsan Valley as a distinct tribe.</p>

<p>As to the Manóbos of Libagánon, it is probable that they have more or
less the same cultural and linguistic characteristics as the Manóbos
that form the subject matter of this paper, but, as I did not visit them
nor get satisfactory information regarding them, I prefer to leave them
untouched until further investigation.</p>

<p>Of the Manóbos of the lower half of the peninsula of San Agustin, I
know absolutely nothing except that they are known as Manóbos. I noted,
however, in perusing the Jesuit letters<sup>14</sup> that there were in
the year 1891 not only Manóbos but Moros, Biláns, and Tagakaólos in that
region.</p>

occupy the mountains from Anao-aon near Surigao down to the break in the
eastern Cordillera, northwest of Liañga. They also inhabit a small range
that extends in a northeasterly direction from the Cordillera to Point
Kawit on the east coast.</p>

<p>I heard three trustworthy reports of the existence of Negritos in
eastern Mindanáo. The first report I heard on the Umaíam River (Walo,
August, 1909). It was given to me by a Manóbo chief from the River
Ihawán. He assured and reassured me that on the Lañgilañg River, near
the Libagánon River exists a group of what he called Manóbos but who
were very small, <i>black as an earthen pot</i>, kinky-haired, without
clothes except bark-cloth, very peaceable and harmless, but very timid.
I interrogated him over and over as to the bark-cloth that he said these
people wore. He said in answer that it was called <i>agahan</i> and that
it was made out of the bark of a tree whose name I can not recall. He
described the process of beating the bark and promised to bring me, 60
days from the date of our conference, a loin cloth of one of these
people. I inquired as to their manner of life, and was assured that they
were <i>tau-batañg</i>; that is, people who slept under logs or up in
trees. He said that he and his people had killed many of them, but that
he was still on terms of friendship with some of them.</p>

<p>The second report as to the existence of Negritos I heard on the
Baglásan River, a tributary of the Sálug River. The chiefs whom I
questioned had never visited the Negritos but had purchased from the
Tugawanons<sup>15</sup> many Negrito slaves whom they had sold to the
Mandáyas of the Kati'il and Karága Rivers. This statement was probably
true, for I saw one slave, a full-blooded Negrito girl, on the upper
Karága during my last trip and received from her my third and most
convincing report of the existence of Negritos other than the Mamánuas
of the eastern Cordillera. She had been captured, she said, by the
Manóbos of Libagánon and sold to the Debabáons (upper Sálug people). She
could not describe the place where her people live, but she gave me the
following information about them. They are all like herself, and they
have no houses nor crops, because they are afraid of the Manóbos that
surround them. Their food is the core<sup>16</sup> of the green rattan
and of fishtail palm,<sup>17</sup> the flesh of wild boar, deer, and
python, and such fish and grubs, etc., as they find in their wanderings.
They sleep anywhere; sometimes even in trees, if they have seen strange
footprints.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>The Tugawanons were described by my Sálug authorities as
a people that lived at the headwaters of the River Libagánon on a
tributary called Tugawan. They were described as a people of medium
stature, as fair as the Mansákas, very warlike, enemies of the reported
Negritos, very numerous, and speaking an Atás dialect. Perhaps the term
Tugawanon is only a local name for a branch of the Atás tribe.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup><i>O-bud</i>.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup><i>Ba-hi</i> (<i>Caryota</i> sp.).</p>

<p>Their weapons are bows and arrows, lances, daggers, and bolos.
According to her description, the bolos are long and thin, straight on
one side and curved on the other. The men purchase them from the Atás in
exchange for beeswax. The people are numerous, but they live far apart,
roaming through the forests and mountains, and meeting one another only
occasionally.</p>

<p>The statements of this slave girl correspond in every particular with
the report that I received on the upper Sálug, except that the Sálug
people called these Negritos Tugmaya and said that they live beyond a
mountain that is at the headwaters of the Libagánon River.</p>

<p>Putting together these three reports and assuming the truth of them,
the habitat of these Negritos must be the slopes of Mount Panombaian,
which is situated between, and is probably the source of, the Rivers
Tigwa (an important tributary of the Rio Grande de Kotabáto), Sábud (the
main western tributary of the Ihawán River), and Libagánon (the great
western influent of the Tágum River).</p>

<p>Montano states that during his visit to the Philippines (1880-81)
there were on the island of Samal a class of half-blood <i>Ata'</i> with
distinctly Negroid physical characteristics. Treating of <i>Ata'</i> he
says that it is a term applied in the south of Mindanáo by Bisáyas to
Negritos &#34;that exist (or existed not long ago) in the interior
toward the northwest of the gulf of Davao.&#34;<sup>18</sup> A careful
distinction must be made between the term Atás<sup>19</sup> and the
racial designation <i>Ata'</i>, for the former are, according to Doctor
Montano, a tribe of a superior type, of advanced culture, and of great
reputation as warriors. They dwell on the northwestern slope of Mount
Apo, hence their name Atás, <i>hatáas</i>, or <i>atáas</i>, being a very
common word in Mindanáo for &#34;high.&#34; They are, therefore, the
people that dwell on the heights. I heard of one branch of them called
Tugawanons, but this is probably only a local name like Agúsanons,
etc.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>Une Mission aux Philippines, 346, 1887.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>Called also Itás.</p>

<p>I found reports of the former existence of Negritos in the Karága
River Valley at a place called Sukipin, where the river has worn its way
through the Cordillera. An old man there told me that his grandfather
used to hunt the Negritos. The Mandáyas both of that region and of
Tagdauñg-duñg, a district situated on the Karága River, five days' march
from the mouth, on the western side of the Cordillera, show here and
there characteristics, physical and cultural, that they could have
inherited only from Negrito ancestors. One interesting trait of this
particular group is the use of blowpipes for killing small birds. In the
use of the bow and arrow, too, they are quite expert. These people are
called <i>taga-butái</i>--that is, mountain dwellers--and live in places
on the slopes of high mountains difficult of access, their
watering-place being frequently a little hole on the side of the
mountain.</p>

<h4>THE BANUÁONS</h4>
</center>

<p>The Banuáons,<sup>20</sup> probably an extension of the Bukídnons of
the Bukídnon subprovince. They occupy the upper parts of the Rivers
Lamiñga, Kandiisan, Hawilian, and Óhut, and the whole of the River
Maásam, together with the mountainous region beyond the headwaters of
these rivers, and probably extend over to the Bukídnons.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>Also called Higaunon or Higagaun, probably &#34;the
Hadgaguanes--a people untamed and ferocious&#34;--to whom the Jesuits
preached shortly after the year 1596. (Jesuit Mission, Blair and
Robertson, 44:60, 1906.) These may be the people whom Pigaffetta, in his
First Voyage Around the World (1519-1522) calls Benaian (Banuáon ?) and
whom he describes as &#34;shaggy and living at a cape near a river in
the islands of Butuán and Karága--great fighters and archers--eating
only raw human hearts with the juice of oranges or lemons&#34; (Blair
and Robertson, 30:243, 1906).</p>

<center>
<a name="1126"></a>
<h4>THE MAÑGGUÁÑGANS</h4>
</center>

<p>This tribe occupies the towns of Tagusab and Pilar on the upper
Agúsan, the range between the Sálug and the Agúsan, the headwaters of
the Mánat River, and the water-shed between the Mánat and the Mawab. The
physical type of many of them bespeaks an admixture of Negrito blood,
and their timidity and, on occasions, their utter lack of good judgment,
brand them as the lowest people, after the Mamánuas, in eastern
Mindanáo. One authority, a Jesuit missionary, I think, estimated their
number at 30,000. An estimate, based on the reports of the people of
Compostela, places their number at 10,000 just before my departure from
the Agúsan Valley in 1910. The decrease, if the two estimates are
correct, is probably due to intertribal and interclan wars.</p>

<center>
<a name="1127"></a>
<h4>THE MANSÁKAS</h4>
</center>

<p>The Mansákas do not seem to me to be as distinct tribally as are the
Manóbos and Mandáyas. It would appear from their physical appearance and
other characteristics that they should be classed as Mandáyas, or as a
subtribe of Mandáyas with whom they form one dialect group. I judge them
to be the result of intermarriage between the Mañgguáñgans and the
Mandáyas. They occupy the Mawab River Valley and the region included
between the Hijo, Mawab, and Madawan Rivers. They are probably the
people whom Montano called Tagabawas, but I think that this designation
was perhaps a mistaken form of <i>Tagabaas</i>, an appellation given to
Mañgguáñgans who live in the <i>bá-as</i>, or prickly swamp-grass, that
abounds at the headwaters of the Mánat River.</p>

<center>
<a name="1128"></a>
<h4>THE DEBABÁONS</h4>
</center>

<p>The Debabáons are probably a hybrid group forming a dialect group
with the Manóbos of the Ihawán and Baóbo, and a culture group in dress
and other features with the Mandáyas. They claim relationship with
Manóbos, and follow Manóbo religious beliefs and practices to a great
extent. For this reason I have retained the name that they apply to
themselves, until their tribal identity can be clearly determined. They
inhabit the upper half of the Sálug River Valley and the country that
lies to the west of it as far as the Baóbo River.</p>

<center>
<a name="1129"></a>
<h4>THE MANDÁYAS</h4>
</center>

<p>These form the greatest and best tribe in eastern
Mindanáo.<sup>21</sup> One who visits the Mandáyas of the middle Kati'il
can not fail to be struck with the fairness of complexion, the brownness
of the hair, the diminutiveness of the hands and feet, and the large
eyes with long lashes that are characteristic of many of these people.
Here and there, too, one finds a distinctly Caucasian type. In
psychological characteristics they stand out still more sharply from any
tribe or group of people that I know in eastern Mindanáo. Shrewd and
diplomatic on the one hand, they are an affectionate, good-natured and
straight-forward people, with little of the timidity and cautiousness of
the Manóbo. Their religious instincts are so highly developed that they
are inclined to be fanatical at times.</p>

<blockquote><p><sup>21</sup>It is very interesting to note that the
people called <i>Taga-baloóyes</i> and referred to by so many of the
writers on Mindanáo can be none other than the Mandáyas. Thus San
Antonio (Blair and Robertson, 40: 407, 1906) states that &#34;the
Taga-baloóyes take their name from some mountains which are located in
the interior of the jurisdiction of Caraga. They are not very far
distant from and trade with the villages of (Karága) and some, indeed,
live in them who have become Christians. * * * These people, as has been
stated above, are the descendants of lately arrived Japanese. This is
the opinion of all the religious who have lived there and had
intercourse with them and the same is a tradition among themselves, and
they desired to be so considered. And it would seem that one is
convinced of it on seeing them: for they are light complexioned,
well-built, lusty, very reliable in their dealings, respectful, and very
valiant, but not restless. So I am informed by one who has had much to
do with them: and above all these are the qualities which we find in the
Japanese.&#34;</p>

<p>In further proof, Father Pedro de San Francisco de Assis (ibid. 41:
138, <i>et seq</i>.) says: &#34;The nearest nation to our village
[Bislig] is that of the Taga-baloóyes who are so named from certain
mountains that they call Balooy. * * * They are a corpulent race, well
built, of great courage and strength, and they are at the same time of
good understanding, and more than halfway industrious. Their nation is
faithful in its treaties and constant in its promises, as they are
descendants, so they pride themselves, of the Japanese, whom they
resemble in complexion, countenance, and manners.&#34; The writer
describes briefly their houses and their manner of life, and mentions in
particular the device they make use of in the construction of their
ladders. It is interesting to note that the same device is still made
use of by the more well-to-do Mandáyas on the Karága, Manorigao, and
Kati'il Rivers. In other respects their character, as described, is very
similar to that of the present Mandáyas of the Kati'il River who in
physical type present characteristics that mark them as being a people
of a superior race.</p>

<p>In Medina's historia (Blair and Roberston, 24:175, 1906,) we find it
related that Captain Juan Niño de Tabora mistreated the chief of the
Taga-baloóyes in Karága and that as a result the captain, Father Jacinto
Cor, and 12 soldiers were killed. Subsequently four more men of the
religious order were killed and two others wounded and captured by the
<i>Taga-baloóyes</i>.</p>

<p>Zuñiga in Estadismo (ibid. 2:71, <i>et seq</i>.) notes the fairness
of complexion of the Taga-baloóyes, a tribe living in the mountains of
Balooy in Karága.</p>

<p>Father Manual Buzeta in Diccionario geográfico-estadístico-histórico
de las Islas Filipinas (1: 506, 1905) makes the same observation, but M.
Felix Renouard de Sainte Croix in Voyage commercial et politique aux
Indes Orientales (1803-1809) goes further still by drawing attention to
these people as meriting distinction for superior mentality.</p>

<p>The Jesuit missionary Pastells in 1883 (Cartas de los PP. de la
Compañía de Jesús, 4:212, 1884) writes that the people above Manresa
(southeastern Mindanáo) are perhaps of Moro origin but bettered by a
strain of noble blood, which their very appearance seems to him to
indicate. In support of this view he cites the authority of Santayana,
who claims Japanese descent for them and repudiates the opinion of those
who attribute Hollandish descent. In a footnote, the above celebrated
missionary and scholar adds that the town of Kinablangan (a town on the
east coast of Mindanáo) owes its origin to a party of Europeans who were
shipwrecked on Point Bagoso and took up their abode in that place,
intermarrying with the natives. I was informed by a Bisáya trader, the
only one that ever went among the mountain Mandáyas, that he had seen a
circular, clocklike article with strange letters upon it in a settlement
on the middle Kati'il. The following year I made every effort to see it,
but I could not prevail upon the possessors to show it to me. They
asserted that they had lost it. It is probable that this object was a
ship's compass.</p></blockquote>

<p>[Transcriber's note: The preceding six paragraphs are all part of
footnote 21.]</p>

<p>On the whole, the impression made upon me in my long and intimate
dealings with the Mandáyas of the Kati'il, Manorigao, and Karága Rivers
is that they are a brave, intelligent, clean, frank people that with
proper handling might be brought to a high state of civilization. They
are looked up to by Manóbos, Mañgguáñgans, Mansákas, and Debabáons as
being a superior and more ancient race, and considered by the Bisáyas of
the Agúsan Valley as a people of much more intelligence and fair-dealing
than any other tribe. The Mandáyas consist of four branches:</p>

<center>
<a name="11291"></a>
<h5>THE TÁGUM BRANCH</h5>
</center>

<p>These occupy the country from near the mouth of the Tágum to the
confluence of the Sálug and Libagánon Rivers, or perhaps a little
farther up both of the last-mentioned rivers. It is probable that the
Debabáons farther up are the issue of Manóbos and Tágum Mandáyas.</p>

<center>
<a name="11292"></a>
<h5>THE AGÚSAN VALLEY BRANCH</h5>
</center>

<p>It is usual for the people of the upper Agúsan from Gerona to
Compostela to call themselves Mandáyas, but this appears to be due to a
desire to be taken for Mandáyas. They have certainly absorbed a great
deal of Mandáya culture and language, but, with the exception of Pilar
and Tagusab, they are of heterogeneous descent--Mandáya, Manóbo,
Mañgguáñgan, Debabáon, and Mansáka.</p>

<p>At the headwaters of the Agúsan and in the mountains that encircle
that region live the Mandáyas that are the terror of Mandáyaland. They
are called by the upper Agúsan people <i>Kau-ó</i>, which means the same
as <i>Tagakaólo</i>, but are Mandáyas in every feature, physical,
cultural, and linguistic.</p>

<center>
<a name="11293"></a>
<h5>THE PACIFIC COAST BRANCH</h5>
</center>

<p>They occupy the following rivers with their tributaries: the Kati'il,
the Baganga, the Mano-rigao, the Karága, the Manai, the Kasaúman, and
the upper reaches of the Mati. There are several small rivers between
the Kasaúman and the Mati, the upper parts of all which, I think, are
occupied by Mandáyas.</p>

<center>
<a name="11294"></a>
<h5>THE GULF OF DAVAO BRANCH</h5>
</center>

<p>These occupy the upper reaches of all the rivers on the east side of
the gulf of Davao, from Sumlug to the mouth of the Hijo River whose
source is near that of the Agúsan and whose Mandáyas are famous in
Mandáyaland.</p>

<center>
<a name="112A"></a>
<h4>THE MOROS</h4>
</center>

<p>Moros or people with a preponderance of Moro blood and culture occupy
the coast towns on the eastern and northern sides of the gulf from
Sumlug to the mouth of the Tágum. Of course they have other settlements
on the north and west sides of the gulf.</p>

<p>In Mati and its vicinity, I believe there are a comparatively large
number of Moros or Mohammedanized Mandáyas.</p>

<center>
<a name="112B"></a>
<h4>THE BILÁNS<sup>22</sup></h4>
</center>

<p><sup>22</sup>Called also, I think, <i>Bi-la-an</i>.</p>

<p>Biláns were found according to the testimony of the Jesuit
missionaries<sup>23</sup> in Sigaboi, Tikbakawan, and Baksal, on the
peninsula of San Agustin.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>Cartas de los PP. de la Compañía de Jesús, 9: 331, <i>et
seq</i>., 1889-1891.</p>

<center>
<a name="112C"></a>
<h4>THE TAGAKAÓLOS</h4>
</center>

<p>According to the authorities just cited there were Tagakaólos in
Sigaboi, Uañgen, Kabuaya, and Makambal between the years 1889 and 1891.
It is probable that these people are scattered throughout the whole of
the hinterland to the west of Pujada Bay, and that they are only
Mandáyas who, unable to withstand the stress of war, fled from the
mountains at the headwaters of the Agúsan River. I base this suggestion
on the fact that the Mandáyas at the headwaters of the Agúsan are known
as, and call themselves, Kau-ó<sup>24</sup> and that they were, and are
probably still at the date of this writing, the terror of Mandáyaland.
If the Tagakaólos of Point San Agustin are fugitive <i>Kau-ó</i>,
according to the prevailing custom they would have retained their former
name; this name, if <i>Kau-ó</i>, would have been changed by Bisáyas and
by Spanish missionaries to <i>Tagakaólo</i>.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup><i>Kau-ó</i> would be <i>Ka-ólo</i> in Bisáya, from the
prefix <i>ka</i>, and <i>ólo</i>, head or source.</p>

<center>
<a name="112D"></a>
<h4>THE LÓAKS OR LÓAGS</h4>
</center>

<p>According to the authority of Father Llopart<sup>25</sup> the Lóaks
dwell in the mountains southwest of Pujada Bay. He says that in customs
they differ from other tribes. They dress in black and hide themselves
when they see anyone dressed in a light color. No stranger is permitted
to enter their dwellings. The same writer goes on to state that their
food is wholly vegetable, excluding tubers, roots, and everything that
grows under the ground. Their chief is called
<i>posáka</i>,<sup>26</sup> &#34;an elder who with his mysterious words
and feigned revelations keeps his people in delusion and under
subjection.&#34; It is the opinion of Father Llopart that these people
are only fugitives, as he very justly concludes from the derivation of
their name.<sup>27</sup></p>

<p><sup>25</sup>Cartas de los PP. de la Compañía de Jesús, 9: 337-338,
1891.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup><i>Posáka</i> means in Malay, and in nearly all known
Mindanáo dialects, an &#34;inheritance&#34; so that in the usage
attributed to these Lóaks it would appear that there may be some idea of
an hereditary chieftainship. The word in Bagóbo, however, means
something beloved, etc., so that the reported Lóak <i>posáka</i> or
chief might be so called because of his being beloved by his people.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup>He states that <i>lóak</i> is probably from <i>lóog</i>,
&#34;to flee,&#34; &#34;to take to the mountains.&#34; In several
dialects of eastern Mindanáo <i>laag</i>, <i>lag</i>, means, &#34;to get
lost,&#34; while <i>lágui</i> is a very common word for &#34;run&#34; or
&#34;run away.&#34;</p>

<p>Another writer, Father Pablo Pastells<sup>28</sup> makes mention of
these Lóak as being wild Tagakaólos who are more degraded than the
Mamánuas. He designates the mountains of Hagimitan on the peninsula of
San Agustin as their habitat. I am inclined to think that the authority
for this statement was also a Jesuit missionary.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup>Ibid., 8: 343, 1887.</p>

<center>
<a name="112E"></a>
<h4>THE CONQUISTAS OR RECENTLY CHRISTIANIZED PEOPLES</h4>
</center>

<p>The work of Christianizing the pagans of eastern Mindanáo was taken
up in earnest in 1877 by the Jesuit missionaries and carried on up to
the time of the revolution in 1898. During that time some 50,000 souls
were led to adopt Christianity. These included Mandáyas, Manóbos,
Debabáons, Mansákas, Mañgguáñgans, and Mamánuas, and members of the
other tribes that live in eastern Mindanáo. For the present, however, we
will refer to the <i>conquistas</i> of the Manóbo, Mandáya, Mamánua,
Mañgguáñgan, Mansáka, and Debabáon tribes.</p>

<center>
<a name="112E1"></a>
<h5>THE MANÓBO CONQUISTAS</h5>
</center>

<p>The inhabitants of all the settlements in the Agúsan Valley except
Novela, Rosario, the towns south of Buai, the towns within the Banuáon
habitat, and a few settlements of pagan Manóbos on the upper Umaíam,
Argáwan, and Ihawán, Wá-wa and Maitum are Manobó <i>conquistas</i>.</p>

<p>On the eastern slope of the Pacific Cordillera in the vicinity of San
Miguel (Tágo River), on the Marihátag and Oteiza Rivers there are
several hundred Manóbo <i>conquistas</i>. The towns up the Hinatuán and
Bislig Rivers are made up of both Manóbo and Mandáya
<i>conquistas</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="112E2"></a>
<h5>THE MANDÁYA CONQUISTAS</h5>
</center>

<p>In the Agúsan Valley the towns on the Sulibáo River and perhaps on
the Adlaian River are made up of Mandáya <i>conquistas</i> for the most
part. These Mandáyas evidently worked in from the Hinatuán River for one
reason or another, perhaps to avoid missionary activity on the east
coast or to escape from Moro raids.</p>

<p>On the Pacific coast we find Mandáya <i>conquistas</i> to a greater
or less extent in nearly all the municipalities and <i>barrios</i> from
Tándag to Mati, with the exception of such towns as have been formed by
immigration of Bisáyas from Bohol and other places. There can be no
doubt but that in former years the Mandáyas covered the whole Pacific
slope from Tándag to Mati, for we still find recently Christianized
Mandáyas in Kolon and Alba on the Tágo River and in Kagwáit and Bakolod
on the Kagwáit River. The inhabitants of these eastern towns are not
known by the designation of <i>conquistas</i>, but assume the name and
status of Bisáyas and are not so dependent on the older Christians as
are the <i>conquistas</i> of the Agúsan Valley who are called
<i>conquistas</i> and treated as inferiors by the older Christians.</p>

<p>I think that from Liñgig to Mati all the barrios, both of the coast
and in the hinterland, are made up of Mandáyas that have been
Christianized since 1877.</p>

<center>
<a name="112E3"></a>
<h5>THE MAMÁNUA CONQUISTAS</h5>
</center>

<p>These Mamánua <i>conquistas</i> live in the vicinity of Anao-aon and
Malimono' on the northeast coast; in San Roque and San Pablo, also on
Lake Maínit; on the River Asiga, a tributary of the River Jabonga; and
somewhere up the Lanusa River on the east coast.</p>

<center>
<a name="112E4"></a>
<h5>THE MAÑGGUÁÑGAN CONQUISTAS</h5>
</center>

<p>During my stay on the upper Agúsan, there were only two towns of
Mañgguáñgan <i>conquistas</i>--Tagusab and Pilar--and even these were
mere suggestions of towns. It may be, however, that since the
appointment of a deputy governor, the great numbers of Christianized
Mañgguáñgans that had fled from the wrath of their enemies into the
swamp region at the headwaters of the Mánat River have returned and that
Mañgguáñgan towns now exist.</p>

<center>
<a name="112E5"></a>
<h5>THE MANSÁKA CONQUISTAS</h5>
</center>

<p>In Compostela, Gandia, and Tagaunud are found a few Mansáka
<i>conquistas</i>. The inhabitants of these towns, however, are of such
a heterogeneous blend that it is difficult to assign any tribal place to
them. It may be said, in general, that these towns are still passing
through a formative period, the result of which will probably be their
complete adoption of Mandáya culture and language, if they are left free
to follow their own bent.</p>

<center>
<a name="112E6"></a>
<h5>THE DEBABÁON CONQUISTAS</h5>
</center>

<p>The Debabáon <i>conquistas</i> are found in the town of Moncayo and
are also scattered about on the upper Sálug. The missionaries found the
Debabáon people very recalcitrant; the comparatively few converts made
evinced, on the one hand, all the fickleness and instability of the
Manóbo and, on the other, the aggressiveness of the Mandáya.</p>

<center>
<a name="113"></a>
<h4>THE BISÁYAS OR CHRISTIAN FILIPINOS</h4>
</center>

<p>The Bisáyas or Christian Filipinos in the Agúsan Valley occupy the
towns of Butuán, Talakógon, Veruéla, Bunáwan, and Prosperidad, of which
latter they formed, during my last visit to the Agúsan Valley, a
majority. Outside of the Agúsan Valley, they occupy all the towns on the
north coast except the towns of Tortosa, Maasao, Tamolayag, and
Malimono'. On, and in the vicinity of Lake Maínit, they occupy the towns
of Sison, Timamana, Maínit, Jabonga, Santiago, Santa Ana and several
other small ones. On the east coast they occupy all the coast towns from
Surigao to Bislig. South of Bislig only the towns, of Kati'il, Baganga,
Karága, Santiago, and Mati may be said to be Bisáya, although the
Christianized Mandáyas of the intervening towns call themselves Bisáyas.
But even the above-mentioned towns, with the exception of Santiago, have
hardly any claim to be considered Bisáya in the sense in which that word
is applied to the Bisáyas of the town of Surigao. The same holds true of
a great portion of the inhabitants of Tándag, Tágo, La Paz, and Kagwáit,
where the Mandáya element in language and in superstitious beliefs still
holds sway to a considerable extent among the lower class of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the Agúsan Valley a great part of the Bisáyas of Talakógon can not
be considered as Bisáyas in the full sense of the word. Many of them
called Sulibáonon are of no higher culture than the <i>conquistas</i> of
the River Sulibáo from which they come. They are distinctly Mandáya in
physical type and in manner of life except that they have abandoned the
ancient Mandáya religious beliefs and adopted those of Christianity.
They are probably the first group of Mandáya <i>conquistas</i> that were
induced to leave the Sulibáo and take up their abode in Talakógon.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<h3>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE MANÓBOS OF
EASTERN MINDANÁO</h3>

<a name="121"></a>
<h4>PHYSICAL TYPE</h4>

<a name="1211"></a>
<h5>DIVERGENCE OF TYPES</h5>
</center>

<p>There seem to be differences in physical type between the Manóbos on
the lower part of the Agúsan as far as the Bugábus River and those of
the Ihawán and the upper Agúsan Rivers. On the upper Agúsan the
variations become more noticeable as we approach the confines of the
Mandáyas and the Debabáons, both of whom differ from the Manóbos in
physical characteristics to such an extent that even an ordinary
observer can not fail to notice it. Again, on the upper Agúsan, in the
vicinity of Tagusab, we find types that remind us of the Mañgguáñgan
with his manifestly Negroid characteristics. Over on the Tágo River,
too, and on the far upper Wa-wa, there are groups of so-called Manóbos
who are clearly descendants of Mamánuas. With these exceptions the
following delineation holds good, I think, for the great mass of Manóbos
with whom one comes in contact throughout eastern Mindanáo.</p>

<center>
<a name="1212"></a>
<h5>GENERAL PHYSICAL TYPE</h5>
</center>

<p>In general, the Manóbo man is of athletic build and of strong
constitution, although he is often short of stature. His muscular
development denotes activity, speed, and endurance rather than great
strength. Corpulency and prominence of the abdomen are never present, so
far as I have observed. His skin, as a rule, is of a reddish-brown color
that turns to a somewhat dark brown after long exposure to the sun, as
in the case of those who engage in fishing in the lake region.</p>

<p>The hair is abundant, long, black, straight, and coarse. As we
approach the domains of the Mañgguáñgans and of the Mamánuas, the hair
is a little less abundant and shows traces of curliness. Occasional
waviness may be observed also among those Manóbos who live near the
territory of the Mandáyas, Debabáons, and Mansákas.</p>

<p>Beard and body hair are not abundant. In this respect the Manóbo
differs from the Mandáya and from the Banuáon, both of whom have a more
copious growth (though I can not be definite as regards the latter
people), and, in some cases, beards that are abundant enough to suggest
admixture with white people.</p>

<p>The head appears to be well developed, being rather high and arched,
as compared with that of the average Bisáya.<sup>1</sup> There is no
flattening of the occiput. This roundness of the posterior part of the
cranium, due, as Montano<sup>2</sup> states, to the prominence of the
parietal bumps, becomes very apparent when comparison is made with the
heads of Bisáyas of other islands. The occipital arch of the latter is
invariably flattened.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>In physical comparisons between Manóbos and Bisáyas no
reference is made to the Bisáyas of eastern Mindanáo, the great majority
of whom are undoubtedly of Manóbo or other pagan origin.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Une Mission aux Philippines, 349,1906.</p>

<p>Owing to the prominence of the jawbones and to the above-mentioned
height of the cranium, the face is decidedly lozenge-shaped, a feature
that distinguishes it, on the one hand, from the long face of the
Mandáya and of the Banuáon and, on the other, from the short, round face
of the Mamánua and of the Mañgguáñgan. Montano<sup>3</sup> says that
this peculiar shape is due to the development of the zygomatic arches or
cheek bones and to the diminution of the minimum frontal line, that is,
the shortest transverse measurement of the forehead.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Loc. cit.</p>

<p>Prognathism is marked but variable according to the testimony of
Montano, who took the anthropometrical measurements of many crania which
he obtained from caves in northeastern Mindanáo.</p>

<p>The forehead is somewhat high and prominent, and the superciliary
ridges are salient. The eyes are brown in color. The palpebral opening
is elongated as compared with that of the Mandáya, whose eye is round.
There is no trace of the Mongolian falciform fold, and the transverse
axis is perfectly horizontal.</p>

<p>The nose is prominent and well-developed but short, and, as a rule,
straight. Toward the confines of the Banuáons we sometimes notice a
slight curve upward at the top. The nostrils are somewhat slender, but
otherwise well developed. They are a little larger than those of
Bisáyas. The ridge is broader than that of Bisáyas, and the root is
lower down.</p>

<p>The lips bear resemblance to those of the Bisáyas except that the
upper lip of the Manóbo is more prominent and more developed, due, it is
suggested, to the universal, incessant practice of carrying a quid of
tobacco partly under it and partly protruding out between it and the
lower lip.</p>

<p>The chin is round and well developed, but is not prominent.</p>

<p>The above statements hold true of the women in all details except
that of stature. The difference between the stature of the male and
female Manóbo is much greater than that between the sexes among Bisáyas
and other civilized people of the Philippines. This difference in the
stature of the sexes is apparent in all the tribes of eastern Mindanáo
with the exception of certain groups of Mandáyas, and may be attributed,
on the one hand, to the excessive burdens carried, and the onerous labor
performed by the women in the discharge of their household and other
duties, and, on the other, to the unencumbered outdoor life pursued by
the men in their hunting, fishing, and trading expeditions.</p>

<p>The other parts of the bodies of both sexes are in good proportions.
The thorax is especially well developed, and the feet are, perhaps,
inordinately large.</p>

<p>The general appearance of the men is somewhat unpleasing and,
perhaps, among the Manóbos of remote regions, might be said to be
coarse. This is especially noticeable among the latter, as their eyes
usually bulge out and give them a somewhat wild and even vindictive air.
The blackening of the teeth and lips, the quid of black tobacco between
the lips, the look of alarm and suspicion, and various other
characteristics all tend to heighten this expression.</p>

<p>The women have a more pleasing expression, but the timid furtive
look, the ungainly gait, and the ungraceful contour of their
<i>abaká</i> skirts, detract from the moderate beauty that they possess
in their youth. After marriage their beauty wanes incredibly fast.</p>

<p>Comparing the Manóbo's physical and general appearance with that of
neighboring peoples, we may say that he stands fifth, the Mandáya,
Mansáka, Debabáon, and Banuáon leading, while below him stand without
any question the Mañgguáñgan and the Mamánua. He has not the height, the
proportions, the fairness, nor the gentility of the first three. He
lacks the nobility, courage, and intelligence of the fourth,<sup>4</sup>
but he maintains his superiority over the Mañgguáñgan, whose repellent
features, sparse hair, scanty clothing, and low intelligence put him
only a little above the Mamánuas. These latter are only poor homeless
forest dwellers like the Negritos of Luzon, and physically, mentally,
and culturally stand lowest in the plane of civilization of all the
people of the eastern Mindanáo.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>My acquaintance with Banuáons is so slight that I can not
make any definite physical comparison.</p>

<center>
<a name="122"></a>
<h4>RACIAL AND TRIBAL AFFINITIES</h4>
</center>

<p>With our present lack of knowledge concerning the great number of
tribes that inhabit not only the island of Mindanáo but Borneo, Sumatra,
and other islands of the Indies, it is impossible to make any definite
statement as to the racial and the tribal affinities of the Manóbo
people.</p>

<center>
<a name="1221"></a>
<h5>MONTANO'S INDONESIAN THEORY</h5>
</center>

<p>Montano proposed the Indonesian theory to explain the origin of the
Samals, Bagóbos, Giangas, Atás, Tagakaólos, Manóbos, and Mandáyas. He
asserts that these peoples are pure Indonesians whose origin can not be
explained otherwise than by supposing them to be the indigenes of all
the islands included under the term Indonesia. Hence he calls the above
tribes Indonesians of Mindanáo.</p>

<p>He claims that these Indonesians are the result of a fusion of three
elements: (1) the Polynesian, (2) the Malay-Bisáya, and (3) the
Negrito.</p>

<p>The Bisáya element, he says, is considerable and becomes apparent in
the increase of transverse diameter of the cranium. The Negrito element
is apparent only in the waviness of the hair, the height and prominence
of the forehead, and the darker color of the skin.</p>

<p>He further states that the anatomical characteristics of these tribes
are their superior stature, their muscular development, and the
prominence of the occipital region in contradistinction to the
flattening noticeable in Malays in general, and especially in those of
the Philippines.</p>

<center>
<a name="1222"></a>
<h5>KEANE'S VIEW</h5>
</center>

<p>Keane in his Ethnology<sup>5</sup> notes that--</p>

<blockquote><p>the term &#34;Indonesian,&#34; introduced by Logan to
designate the light-colored non-Malay inhabitants of the Eastern
Archipelago, is now used as a convenient collective name for all the
peoples of Malaysia and Polynesia who are neither Malays nor Papuans but
of Caucasic type. * * * Doctor Hamy, who first gave this extension to
the term Indonesian, points out that the Battaks and other pre-Malay
peoples of Malaysia so closely resemble the Eastern Polynesians, that
the two groups should be regarded as two branches of an original
non-Malay stock. Although all speak dialects of a common
Malayo-Polynesian language, the physical type is quite distinct and
rather Caucasic than Mongolic, though betraying a perceptible Papuan (or
Negrito) strain especially in New Zealand and Mikronesia. The true
Indonesians are of tall stature (5 feet 10 inches), muscular frame,
rather oval features, high, open forehead, large straight or curved
nose, large full eyes always horizontal and with no trace of the third
lid, light brown complexion (cinnamon or ruddy brown), long black hair,
not lank but slightly curled or wavy, skull generally brachycephalous
like that of the Melanochroic European.</p></blockquote>

<p><sup>5</sup>Ethnology, 326 <i>et seq</i>., 1901.</p>

<p>Regarding the Indonesians of the Philippine Islands, he
says:<sup>6</sup></p>

<blockquote><p>Apart from the true Negrito aborigines Blumentritt
distinguishes two separate &#34;Malay&#34; invasions, both prehistoric.
Montano also recognizes these two elements which, however, he more
correctly calls Indonesian and Malay. The Indonesians whom he affiliates
to the &#34;Polynesian family&#34; were the first to arrive, being
followed by the Malays and then, in the sixteenth century, by the
Spaniards, who were themselves followed, perhaps also preceded, by
Chinese and others. Thus Blumentritt's Malays of the first invasion,
whom he brings from Borneo, are Montano's Indonesians, who passed
through the Philippines during their eastward migrations from Borneo and
other parts of Malaysia. The result of these successive movements was
that the Negritoes were first driven to the recesses of the interior by
the Indonesians with whom they afterwards intermingled in various
degrees. Then the Indonesians were in their turn driven by the Malays
from the coast lands and open plains, which are consequently now found
occupied mainly by peoples of true Malay stock. Then with peaceful times
fresh blends took place and to previous crossings are now added
Spaniards and Chinese with Malays, there &#34;quadroons&#34; and
&#34;octoroons&#34; with Indonesians, and even here and there with
Negritoes. It has thus become difficult everywhere to distinguish
between the true Malays and the Indonesians, who are also less known,
dwelling in the more remote upland districts, often in association with
the Negritoes and not always standing at a much higher grade of
culture.</p></blockquote>

<a name="1223"></a>
<h5>THE INDONESIAN THEORY AS APPLIED TO MANÓBOS</h5>
</center>

<p>Comparing the physical characteristics of the Manóbos with those
which are predicated of the Indonesians by these and other writers, I
find that, in the case of the Manóbos of the Agúsan Valley, in stature,
waviness of the hair, abundance of the beard, and lightness of the skin
color there appears to be a divergence from Keane's Indonesian standard.
Keane requires 1.795 meters as an average for the stature of the
Indonesian, whereas the average of the Manóbo, as I found it from
cursory measurements, is approximately only 1.60 meters and Doctor
Montano found it to be only 1.4667 meters. As to waviness of the hair, I
have observed it rarely among the Manóbos to which this paper refers.
Neither is the beard abundant, and as for fairness in the color of the
skin, a casual glance at the great mass of Manóbos that occupy the
Agúsan and its tributaries will convince one that their color is
decidedly ruddy brown and not light. It is true that in the mountains
children and even young women are found with fair complexions, but this
is probably due to confinement in the house or to protection from the
sun while out of doors.</p>

<center>
<a name="123"></a>
<h4>PHYSICAL TYPE OF CONTIGUOUS PEOPLES</h4>
</center>

<p>In the first part of this chapter a broad comparison was made between
the Manóbos and the contiguous tribes of eastern Mindanáo, but, in order
to bring out in stronger relief the physical characteristics of the
Manóbo, it is considered expedient to give a brief description of the
contiguous tribes.</p>

<center>
<a name="1231"></a>
<h5>THE MAÑGGUÁÑGANS</h5>
</center>

<p>In stature the Mañgguáñgan is shorter than the Manóbo. His physical
configuration gives one the impression that he is undersized. His
cranium is elongated from the front backward along the antero-posterior
curve, there being formed accordingly an enlargement on the upper part
of the occiput. From this enlargement downward there is a flattening of
the curve. The forehead is large, high, and very prominent, and diverges
backward from the plane of the face at an observable angle. The face is
narrow and flat, the narrowness being due to the prominence of the lower
jaw and to a depression that is formed in the side of the face between
the jaw and the cheek bone. The hair is lank, coarse, and in males,
scant. The beard is very sparse except in elderly men, and even then it
is far from being as abundant as that of the Manóbos and especially that
of the Mandáyas. The nose is broad and conspicuously depressed, while
the nasal orifices are rather large. On the whole, the prognathism is
considerable but is not as variable as that of Manóbos and of
Mandáyas.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt as to the Negritic character of the
Mañgguáñgan. Owing to the peculiar circumstances that arose after my
arrival on the upper Agúsan in 1909, I found it impossible to get into
communication with any but the more domesticated Mañgguáñgan in the
vicinity of Compostela, but my observation of their physical and mental
characteristics and of their low degree of culture led me to a strong
conviction of a Negrito origin not far removed.</p>

<center>
<a name="1232"></a>
<h5>THE MANDÁYAS</h5>
</center>

<p>The Mandáya, on the other hand, with the exception of groups on the
upper Karága and perhaps on the upper Kasaúman Rivers, is of superior
stature. Montano found the stature to be only 1.578 meters, but the
number of men measured by him was so small that we can not base any
conclusion on his figures. I did not make any measurements of Mandáyas,
but it is my impression that the male Mandáyas of the Kati'il, Karága,
and Manorigao Rivers are noticeably taller than Manóbos. In fact, one
meets a great number that seem to come up to the Indonesian standard of
Keane.</p>

<p>The Mandáya's cranial conformation differs, according to Montano,
from that of the Manóbo only in one particular, namely, in the
straightness of the middle part of the antero-posterior curve of the
cranium. In other respects his cranium is similar to that of the Manóbo.
The face is oval rather than lozenge-shaped and has a pleasant,
sympathetic look, due no doubt to the greater width of the palpebral
opening, the largeness of the eye, and the length, darkness, and
prominence of the eyelashes.</p>

<p>The nose is straight and prominent, occasionally quite European, and
the nostrils are not depressed nor flattened. Their lower edges, instead
of being horizontal, slant slightly upward from the tip. The nasal
apertures are of medium size.</p>

<p>The superciliary ridges are prominent, but as the hair of the
eyebrows is constantly kept shaved, there is not such an impression of
prominence as in the Christianized Mandáyas of the southeastern seaboard
of Mindanáo.</p>

<p>As to the abundance of beard, it is hard to form a judgment because
from youth it is constantly and conscientiously eradicated. The hair of
the head is long, black, and abundant, often somewhat wavy and not as
coarse, I think, as that of Manóbos.</p>

<p>The most striking characteristic of the Mandáya is his fair color. It
is not my intention to give the impression that he is one of a &#34;lost
white tribe&#34; or that he is entitled to be called white in the sense
in which we use the term when speaking of Europeans. But for a native of
the Philippine Islands he certainly may be denominated white, though his
skin is not tawny white like that of the Japanese or Chinese but has a
peculiar ashy tint. I have seen a few individuals that were very nearly
as white as the average American, but who otherwise were not of a
pronounced Caucasian type.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to explain the prevailing fairness of this tribe
except by presupposing an admixture of some other blood. The Manóbo
lives in as dark forests and on as lofty mountains as those occupied by
Mandáyas. His manner of life is practically the same, and yet the
average tint of his skin is far darker, so much so that the Mandáya, in
speaking not only of him but of Mañgguáñgan and even of Bisáya, spurns
them all as being &#34;black.&#34;</p>

<center>
<a name="1233"></a>
<h5>THE DEBABÁONS</h5>
</center>

<p>As to the Debabáons, I have not come in touch with a sufficient
number of them to enable me to make any general statements. The groups
that I met in Moncayo, on the Sálug where the Baglásan River empties
into it, and in the country extending some 10 kilometers to the west of
it, closely resemble the Mandáyas in physical characters, and yet in
language, general culture, and religious belief, and by genealogy, they
belong to the Manóbo tribe. It is probable that they are the result of
intermarriage of Manóbo men of Baóbo and Ihawán origin with Mandáya
women of the lower Sálug and Tágum Rivers.</p>

<center>
<a name="1234"></a>
<h5>THE MAMÁNUAS</h5>
</center>

<p>The Mamánuas need little comment. They are full-blooded Negritos in
every respect, physical and cultural, like the Negritos of Mariveles, as
Montano very explicitly states. The Manóbos of the upper Tágo River
constantly intermarry with Mamánua women, as I had occasion to observe
on several visits which I made to that region. It is probable that the
same thing takes place on the Húbo, Marihátag, Lanusa, and Kantílan
Rivers. In the vicinity of Lake Maínit, a great many Mamánuas are
reported to be half-breeds.</p>

<center>
<a name="1235"></a>
<h5>THE BANUÁONS</h5>
</center>

<p>I visited only one settlement of Banuáons, near the mouth of the
Maásam River. I met members of the tribe here and there along the Agúsan
between San Luis and Las Nieves, but my observations of them were casual
and superficial so that I am not prepared to make any statements as to
their physical characteristics. All reports, both of Manóbos and Bisáyas
and the testimony of the Jesuit missionaries, state that they are a
superior people. It is probable that this group of people, known as
Banuáon in the Agúsan Valley, is a branch of the Bukídnons of whom the
celebrated missionary Urios and others make such commendatory
mention,<sup>7</sup> the former in one place going so far as to make the
statement that the Bukídnons are fit to be kings of the Manóbos.</p>

<center>
<a name="124"></a>
<h4>PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AS MODIFIED BY DRESS AND ORNAMENTATION</h4>
</center>

<p>The upper garment of both sexes among the Manóbos is a closed
square-cut garment with sleeves and with a sufficient opening on top to
admit the head. It fits the body either closely or fairly loosely. It is
made of <i>abaká</i> fiber when imported cloth is not available. It is
always adorned with embroidery of imported red, white, blue, and yellow
cotton, on the cuffs, on the seams of the shoulders and the side, and on
the neck and lower edges. The garment of the man differs from that of
the woman in being all of one color, except that across the back, over
the shoulders, and as far down as the breasts, are horizontal, parallel,
equidistant lines of inwoven blue cotton yarn.</p>

<p>The body and sleeves of the woman's garment are of different colors.
Thus, if the sleeves are black, the body is red and vice versa. Another
distinguishing feature is the profuseness of cotton embroidery on the
front of the garment.</p>

<p>The lower garment of the man is a pair of trousers, generally of
native cotton and <i>abaká</i> fiber, reaching somewhat below the knees,
with cotton embroidery in the above-mentioned colors on the sides and at
the bottom. The ends of the draw string that holds the trousers in place
hang down in front and are ornamented with tassels of the same
colors.</p>

<p>The lower garment of the women is a doubled sacklike skirt of
<i>abaká</i> fiber, almost invariably of a reddish color, with beautiful
designs in horizontal panels or with a series of horizontal equidistant
black stripes. A girdle of human hair or of plaited vegetable fiber,
held in place with a shell button or with a plaited cord, retains this
garment in place. The consequent gathering of the capacious opening of
the skirt at the waist and the bulging out at the bottom (which is just
a little below the knees), detracts not a little from the gracefulness
of the Manóbo woman's figure. From the girdle hang, in varying number
and quality, beads, hawk bells, redolent, medicinal, and magic seeds,
sea shells, and fragrant herbs.</p>

<p>The hair is worn long by both sexes. It is dressed much like that of
a Chinese woman except that it is twisted and tied up in a chignon on
the crown of the head.</p>

<p>The man wears a long narrow bamboo hat which protects only the top of
the head, and which is held on the head by two strings passing from end
to end behind the ears. It usually has a plume of feathers standing up
at right angles to the back part. The woman wears no hat as a general
rule, but in lieu thereof adorns her head with a bamboo comb, at times
inlaid with mother-of-pearl, at others covered with a lamina of beaten
silver, but nearly always ornamented with decorative incisions. A pair
of ear plugs with ornamental metal laminae are placed in the enlarged
ear lobes.</p>

<p>I have seen men who had each ear lobe pierced in one or two places
and small buttons fastened over the orifices, but I never saw a case of
a Manóbo woman with any other perforation in the ears than the great
aperture in each lobe for her ear disks.</p>

<p>Around the neck the woman wears in more or less profusion, according
to her means and opportunities for purchase, necklets of beads, and
necklaces of seeds, beads, shells, and crocodile teeth.</p>

<p>On her forearms she wears one or more sea-shell bracelets, circlets
of black coral or of copper wire, and a close-fitting ringlet of plaited
<i>nito</i>. This last adornment is also worn by men, who dispense with
the use of other forms of bracelets, but who usually adorn the upper arm
with a finely plaited ligature made of a dark fibrous vine. Both men and
women frequently wear similar ligatures just below one or both knees. On
solemn and festive occasions the woman decks her ankles with loose coils
of heavy wire.</p>

<p>A square knapsack of hemp, frequently fringed with cotton yarn of
many colors and suspended from the back by strings passing over the
shoulders and under the arms, constitutes the man's receptacle for his
chewing paraphernalia. It may be more or less elaborate in beadwork and
embroidery, but as a rule there is no ornamentation of this kind.</p>

<p>Both sexes blacken the lips with soot black, and continually keep
them more or less in that condition by the use of a large quid of
tobacco, mixed with lime and <i>máu-mau</i> juice, the whole being
carried between the lips. This mixture serves not only as an
indispensable and pleasing narcotic, but also as the principal factor in
bringing about the complete and permanent staining of the teeth.</p>

<p>In order that &#34;they may not look like dogs,&#34; both sexes have
the upper and lower incisors ground at an early age. They proceed at
once to stain what is left with frequent applications of the
above-mentioned masticatories.</p>

<p>As white and sharp teeth are doglike, so beard and body hair are
suggestive of the monkey. Hence all straggling hairs are sedulously and
constantly eradicated.</p>

<p>Tattooing by both sexes is universal. It consists of the puncturing
of the skin and the rubbing in of a soot made from a very common variety
of resin. The figures tattooed, often artistic, are representations of
stars, leaves, crocodiles, etc.</p>

<p>Both sexes are tattooed on the breast, arms, and fingers, but it is
customary for women to have an extra design on the calves of the legs
and sometimes on the whole leg.</p>

<p>As to the Christianized Manóbos, it is obvious that the great
majority have adopted the garb of their Bisáya brethren and abandoned
the use of ornaments and mutilations characteristic of their pagan
compeers. The change was enjoined by Spanish missionaries for religious
reasons and, in the case of clothing, was encouraged by Bisáya traders
for commercial motives, but did not benefit the new Christians, as far
as my observation goes, either religiously, financially, or
esthetically.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<h3>A SURVEY OF THE MATERIAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL CULTURE OF THE MANÓBOS OF
EASTERN MINDANÁO</h3>

<a name="131"></a>
<h4>GENERAL MATERIAL CULTURE</h4>

<a name="1311"></a>
<h5>DWELLINGS</h5>
</center>

<p>For a home the Manóbo selects a site that is clearly approved by
supernatural agencies, and that is especially suitable for agricultural
purposes by reason of its fertility, and for defense, because of its
strategic position. Hereon he builds an unpretentious, square,
one-roomed building at a height of from 1.50 meters to 8 meters from the
ground. The house measures ordinarily about 3 meters by 5 meters. Posts,
usually light, and varying in number between 4 and 16, support the
floor, roof, and intervening parts. The materials are all rattan lashed
and seldom consist of anything but light materials taken from the
immediate vicinity. The floor is made of slats of palm or bamboo, the
roof is thatched with palm leaves, and the walls are light, horizontal,
superimposed poles laid to about the height of the shoulders of a person
sitting on the floor. The space between the top of the walls and the
roof constitutes a continuous window. This open space above the low
house wall permits the inmates during a fight to shoot their arrows at
the enemy in any direction.</p>

<p>The one ceilingless room serves for kitchen, bedroom, and reception
room. There is no decoration nor furniture. Scattered around or hung up,
especially in the vicinity of the fireplace, are the simple household
utensils, and the objects that constitute the property of the
owner--weapons, baskets, and sleeping mats. On the floor farthest away
from the door are the hearth frames, one or more, and the stones that
serve as support for the cooking pots. A round log with more or less
equidistant notches, leading from the ground up to the narrow doorway,
admits the visitor into the house.</p>

<p>Under the house is the pigpen. Here the family pigs and the chickens
make a living off such refuse or remnants as fall from above. The
sanitary condition of this part of the establishment is in no wise
praiseworthy. The only redeeming point is that the bad odors do not
reach the house, being carried away by the current of air that is nearly
always passing.</p>

<p>The house itself is far from being perfectly clean. The low,
cockroach-infested thatch, the smoke-begrimed rafters, the unswept,
dirt-bestrewn floor, the bug-infested slats, the smoke-laden atmosphere,
the betel-nut-tinged walls and floor, these and other features of a
small over-populated house make cleanliness almost impossible. The order
and quietude of the home is no more satisfactory. The crying of the
babies, the romping and shouting of the boys, the loud talking of the
elders, the grunting of the pigs below, the whining and growling of the
dogs above, and the noise of the various household occupations produce
in an average house containing a few families a din that baffles
description. But this does not disturb the serenity of the primitive
inmates, who laugh, chew, talk, and work, and enjoy themselves all the
more for the animation of which they form a great part.</p>

<a name="1312"></a>
<h5>ALIMENTATION</h5>
</center>

<p>In the absence of such a luxury as matches, the fire-saw or friction
method of producing fire is resorted to, although the old steel and
flint method is sometimes employed.</p>

<p>The cooking outfit consists of a few homemade earthen pots,
supplemented by green bamboo joints, bamboo ladles, wooden rice paddles,
and nearly always a coconut shell for receiving water from the long
bamboo water tube.</p>

<p>The various articles of food may be divided into two classes, one of
which we will call the staple part of the meal and the other the
concomitant. It must be remembered that for the Manóbo, as well as for
so many other peoples of the Philippine Islands, rice or <i>camotes</i>
or some other bulky food is the essential part of the meal, whereas
fish, meat, and other things are merely complements to aid in the
consumption of the main food. Under the heading, then, of staples we may
classify in the order of their importance or abundance the following:
<i>Camotes</i>, rice, taro, sago, cores of wild palm trees, maize,
tubers and roots (frequently poisonous). Among the concomitant or
supplementary foods are the following, their order being indicative of
the average esteem in which they are held: Fish (especially if salted),
domestic pork, wild boar meat (even though putrefied), venison, iguana,
larvae from rotted palm trees, python, monkey, domestic chicken, wild
chicken, birds, frogs, crocodile, edible fungi, edible fern, and bamboo
shoots. As condiments, salt, <i>if on hand</i>, and red pepper are
always used, but it is not at all exceptional that the latter alone is
available.</p>

<p>Sweetpotatoes, taro, tubers, and rice are cooked by steaming. Maize
and the cores of palm trees are roasted over the fire.</p>

<p>There are only two orthodox methods of cooking fish, pork, venison,
iguana and chicken: (1) In water without lard; (2) by broiling. Python,
monkey, crocodile, wild chicken, and birds must be prepared by the
latter method.</p>

<p>When the meal is prepared, it is set out on plates, banana leaves, or
bark platters, with the water in glasses or in the coconut-shell dipper.
On ordinary occasions the husband, wife, children and female relatives
of a family eat together, the unmarried men, widowers, and visitors
partaking of their meals alone, but on festive occasions, all the male
members, visitors included, gather in the center of the floor.</p>

<p>The hands and mouth are washed both before and after the meal. All
begin to eat together on the floor. The men eat with their left hands
and, on occasions, when the remotest suspicion of trouble exists, keep
their right hand on their ever-present weapons. It is customary not to
leave one's place after the meal without giving due notice.</p>

<center>
<a name="1313"></a>
<h5>NARCOTIC AND STIMULATING ENJOYMENTS</h5>
</center>

<p>The most common and indispensable source of everyday enjoyment is the
betel-nut quid, It would be an inexcusable breach of propriety to
neglect to offer betel nut to a fellow tribesman. Not to partake of it
when offered would be considered a severance of friendship. The
essential ingredients of the quid are betel leaf, betel nut, and lime,
but it is common to add tobacco, cinnamon, lemon rind, and several other
aromatic elements. At times substitutes may be used for the betel leaf
and the betel nut, if there is a lack of either.</p>

<p>Another important masticatory is the tobacco quid with its
ingredients of lime and <i>máu-mau</i> juice. This is carried constantly
between the lips. Occasionally, however, the men like to smoke a little
mixed tobacco in small pipes or in little leaf cones.</p>

<p>The greatest and the most cherished enjoyment of all is drinking:
Men, women, and children indulge, the last two sparingly. In Manóboland
the fame of a banquet is in direct proportion to the number of those who
became drunk, sobriety being considered effeminate, and a refusal to
drink an affront to the host.</p>

<p>The main drinks are of four kinds: <i>Cabo negro</i> toddy, sugarcane
brew, <i>bahi</i> toddy, and mead. The first and third are nothing but
the sap of the palms that bear their respective names, the sap being
gathered in the same manner as the ordinary coconut <i>tuba</i>. The
second or sugarcane brew is a fermented drink made from the juice of the
sugarcane boiled with a variety of the ginger plant. It is the choice
drink of Manóbo deities. The fourth drink mentioned above is mead. It is
similar to the last mentioned except that instead of sugar-cane juice,
honey is used in its preparation.</p>

<p>One feature of the drinking is that it is seldom unaccompanied by
meat or fish. Hence, on every occasion that a supply of these may be
obtained, there is a drinking bout. Religious sacrifices, too, afford
abundant opportunity for indulgence.</p>

<p>Quarrels sometimes ensue as a result of the flowing bowl, and war
expeditions are proposed, but on the whole it may be said that the
Manóbo is a peaceful and a merry drinker.</p>

<center>
<a name="1314"></a>
<h5>MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE</h5>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo makes his living by farming, fishing, hunting, and
trapping. He clears a patch of the primeval forest, and his womenfolk
clean off the brush, sow broadcast a little rice, plant <i>camotes</i>,
some taro, maize, and sugarcane. As the rice crop seldom is sufficient
for the sustenance of his household, the Manóbo must rely also on the
<i>camote</i> for his maintenance.</p>

<p>He obtains his supply of fish from the streams and rivers. When the
water is deep and the current is not strong, he shoots the fish with a
special bow and arrow. When the water is shallow and swift, he makes use
of bamboo traps and at times poisons the whole stream.</p>

<p>To provide himself with meat, he occasionally starts off into the
forest with dogs and seldom returns without a deer or a wild boar. He
keeps several spring traps set somewhere in the forest but it is only
during the rainy season that he may be said to be successful with these.
He has a trap for monkeys, a snare for birds, a decoy for wild chickens,
and uses his bow and arrow on monkeys and birds.</p>

<p>With the meat that he procures from the above sources, together with
lizards and pythons which he sometimes catches, and fungi, larvae, and
palm trees, which he finds in the forest, he manages to fill in the
intervals between the ceremonial and the secular celebrations that recur
so frequently during the year, and to keep himself fairly well
supplied.</p>

<center>
<a name="1315"></a>
<h5>WEAPONS AND IMPLEMENTS</h5>
</center>

<p>The bolo and, in some districts, the dagger, is the inseparable
companion of the Manóbo. On the trails he always carries a lance and
frequently a shield. For war he has an <i>abaká</i> coat of mail and a
bow and arrow. In time of alarm he sets out bamboo caltrops, makes an
abatis of fallen trees, and places human spring traps around his lofty
house.</p>

<p>For work he has a bolo and a primitive adze[sic]. These, with a rice
header, a small knife, a hunting spear, a special arrow for hunting, a
fish spear, and perhaps a few fishhooks, serve all the purposes of his
primitive life. With one or the other of these he fells the mighty trees
of the primordial forest, performs all the operations of agriculture, of
hunting and fishing, builds himself a house, in certain districts hews
out shapely canoes, whittles out handsome bolo sheaths, and makes a
variety of other necessary and often artistic articles. They are the sum
total of his tools and serve him instead of all the implements of modern
civilization.</p>

<center>
<a name="1316"></a>
<h5>INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES</h5>
</center>

<p>The burden of toil falls on the woman. The man fells the heavy timber
once a year, builds the house, hunts, fishes, traps, and fights.
Practically all the rest of the daily labor is the woman's share. The
man is the master, and as such he attends to all matters that may arise
between his family and that of others.</p>

<p>Besides the occupations mentioned above, the man may engage, usually
under the stress of a contract or of a debt, in canoe making, mining,
and basket making.</p>

<p>The women weave all the clothes of the family except when imported
cloth has been obtained. Most of the Manóbos' clothes, both for men and
women, are made of native-woven cloth. The woman does all the sewing. A
needle of brass wire in the absence of an imported needle, and a thread
of <i>abaká</i> fiber, constitute her sewing outfit.</p>

<p>Almost all the material employed in weaving is <i>abaká</i> fiber.
The dyes are vegetable, their fastness depending upon the duration of
the boiling. The Manóbo woman, unlike the Mandáya women, and women of
most other tribes in Mindanáo, has never developed the art of inweaving
ornamental figures. The best she can do is to produce warp and weft
stripes.</p>

<p>The making of simple earthen pots is also one of the industries of
the woman. Pots are not, however, made in great quantities, the demand
being, I think, a little greater than the supply.</p>

<p>Bed mats and rice bags are made out of various materials such as
<i>pandanus</i> and <i>buri</i> in the ordinary Philippine style. The
work is done principally by the woman and the supply is not equal, as a
rule, to the family needs.</p>

<center>
<a name="1317"></a>
<h4>GENERAL SOCIOLOGICAL CULTURE</h4>

<a name="1318"></a>
<h5>DOMESTIC LIFE</h5>
</center>

<a name="13181"></a>
<p><i>Marital relations</i>.--In his choice of a wife the man is guided
to a great extent by the wishes of his relatives, but the woman is given
no option. There are no antenuptial relations between the pair, the
marriage contract and all arrangements being made by their respective
relatives. The transactions usually cover years. The woman's relatives
demand for her an amount of worldly goods--slaves, pigs, bolos, and
spears--that is almost impossible of payment. The man's relatives, on
the other hand, strive to comply, but make use of every means to gain
the friendship of the other side and thereby bring about a more
considerate demand.</p>

<p>When, perhaps after years of effort, an agreement is reached, a great
feast is prepared by the two parties. The final payment is made by the
man's relatives, and the following day a reciprocal banquet is given by
the girl's relatives, in the course of which one-half of the value of
the payment made by the man's relatives is returned by the girl's
relatives as an indication that &#34;she has not been sold like a
slave.&#34;</p>

<p>The marriage ceremony consists in the exchange of rice between the
bride and the bridegroom. This is followed by a religious rite that
consists mainly in determining by divination the fate of the couple.</p>

<p>Marriage is sometimes effected by capture, usually, I think, with the
connivance of the woman. But the procedure involves a heavier payment to
the throng of armed relatives that invariably set out in pursuit of the
captors.</p>

<p>Prenatal marriage contracts are rare, but child marriage without
cohabitation is practiced to a certain extent, especially among the more
influential members of the tribe.</p>

<p>The age for marriage is about the age of puberty for the women and
about the age of 18 for the men. Polygamy is a recognized institution,
but is comparatively rare except among those who have the means to pay
for the luxury of a second, third, or fourth wife. It presupposes the
consent of the first wife, who always retains and maintains her
position, there being no jealously, as far as my observation goes, and
few domestic broils. Polyandry is considered swinish, and concubinage is
unknown. Divorce is not in accord with tribal customs. The same holds
true of prostitution.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of the practice of endogamy which is so
widespread among the Oceanic peoples. As a rule, however, the Manóbo
marries within his own tribe. This is due to his environment, to the
hostile relations he ever holds with surrounding tribes, and to
differences of religious beliefs. The only impediment to marriage is
consanguinity, but even this impediment may be removed in the case of
cousins by appropriate religious ceremonies. Consanguineous marriages
are rare.</p>

<p>Upon the death of the husband, the wife is considered to belong to
his relatives. Upon the presentation of a second suitor, she is
remarried in the same manner as on her first marriage, but the payments
demanded are not so high.</p>

<p>Marriages seem to result in reciprocal good understanding and
happiness. The wife goes about her manifold duties day after day without
a murmur, while her master keeps his weapons in good condition, fishes
and hunts occasionally, goes on a trading trip at times, takes part in
social gatherings, lends his voice in time of trouble, and goes off to
fight if there should be occasion for it.</p>

<p>Faithfulness to the marriage tie is one of the most striking features
of Manóboland. Adultery is extremely rare. The husband lives, at least
during the first part of the married life, with his father-in-law, and
displays toward his parents-in-law the same feelings that he entertains
for his own parents. His wife is always under the eyes of her own
parents, so that he is restrained from indulging in any marital
bickerings.</p>

<a name="13182"></a>
<p><i>Pregnancy, birth, and childhood</i>.--The desire for children is
strong. Hence voluntary abortion and infanticide are unknown. In case of
involuntary abortion, which is comparatively frequent, the fetus is hung
or buried under the house. When the child begins to quicken in the womb,
the mother undergoes a process of massage at the beginning of every
lunar month.</p>

<p>Parturition is effected almost invariably without any difficulty, the
umbilical cord is cut usually with a bamboo sliver, the mother sits up
to prevent a reflux of the afterbirth into the womb, the child is
washed, and the operation is over. If the mother can not suckle her
child it is nourished with rice water, sugar cane juice, and other light
food, but is not given to another to be suckled. In a few days after her
delivery the mother is up and back at her work. A little birth party
takes place soon after the birth in which the midwife receives a slight
guerdon for her services.</p>

<p>The child is named, without any ceremony, after some ancestor or
famous Manóbo, or occasionally receives a name indicative of something
which happened at the time of the birth. He is treated with the greatest
tenderness and lack of restraint. As he grows up he learns the ways of
the forest, and about the age of 14 he is a full-fledged little man. If
the child is a girl, she helps her mother from the first moment that she
is able to be of service.</p>

<p>Birth anomalies are rare. I have seen several albinos and several
people who might be called in a loose sense hermaphrodites.</p>

<a name="13183"></a>
<p><i>Medicine, sickness, and death</i>.--The Manóbo attributes some
twelve bodily ailments to natural causes, and for the cure of such he
believes in the efficacy of about as many herbs and roots. For wounds,
tobacco juice and the black residue of the smoking pipe are considered a
good remedy. Betel nut and betel leaf are a very common cure for pains
in the stomach. The gall of snakes has a potency of its own for the same
trouble.</p>

<p>As a rule, all natural remedies are applied externally until such
time as they prove unavailing, and the symptoms assume a more serious
aspect.</p>

<p>Whenever an ailment is of a lingering character, especially if
accompanied by increasing emaciation and not classifiable as one of the
familiar maladies, it is attributed to magic causes. Certain individuals
may have the reputation of being able to compound various noxious
substances, the taking of which, it is believed, may superinduce
lingering ailments. The pulverized bone from a corpse or the blood of a
woman, dried in the sun and exposed to the light of the moon and then
mixed with finely cut human hair, are example of such compounds. Other
magic medicines exist such as aphrodisiacs, and bezoar stones. When it
is decided that the ailment is due to any of these magic causes,
neutralizing methods must be resorted to, the nature and application of
which are very secret.</p>

<p>Epidemics are attributed to the malignancy of sea demons, and by way
of propitiation, and inducement to these plague spirits to hurry off
with their epidemic, offerings placed on raftlets are launched in the
nearest rivers.</p>

<p>As soon as it is realized that the malady is beyond the power of
natural or of magic resources, recourse is had to the deities or good
spirits, as will be explained under the resume of religion. Upon the
occurrence of a death, wild scenes frequently take place, the relatives
being unable to restrain their grief. Signals, by bamboo horns, are
often boomed out to neighboring settlements to warn them to be on their
guard. War raids to settle old feuds are sometimes decided upon on these
occasions, so all trails leading to the house are closed.</p>

<p>The corpse is washed and laid out on its back in its best apparel.
The coffin is a hexagonal piece of wood made out of a log with a
three-faced lid also hewn out of a log. The body is often wrapped in a
grass mat before being laid in the coffin.</p>

<p>Before decomposition sets in, the coffin is borne away by men amidst
great grief and loud shouts. A high piece of ground is selected in a
remote part of the forest for the last resting place of the deceased. A
shallow grave is dug, a roof of thatch is erected, a potful of boiled
rice is placed over the grave as a last collation for the departed one,
and the burial party hurry back in fear to the settlement. As soon as
they can provide themselves with temporary huts they almost always
abandon the settlement.</p>

<a name="13184"></a>
<p><i>Social and Family enjoyments</i>.--Music, instrumental and vocal,
and dancing are the two great sources of domestic enjoyment. There are
several kinds of instruments, which I will mention in the order of their
importance and frequency of use. The drum, the gong, four varieties of
flutes, four species of guitars, a violin, and a jew's-harp. With the
exception of the first two, the instruments are made of bamboo and are,
in every sense of the word, of the most primitive kind. The strings are
of vine, bamboo, or <i>abaká</i> fiber.</p>

<p>The drum is the instrument of most frequent use. It is played during
all dancing and at other times when a tribesman feels inclined. It is
used as a signal to give alarm or to call an absent one. During the
dance, religious or secular, it is nearly always accompanied by the
gong. The use of the other instruments seems to depend upon the caprice
of the individuals, though two of them appear to have a religious
character.</p>

<p>With the exception of the gong and the Jew's-harp, all of these
instruments can be made to produce varied and pleasing rhythms or music,
according to the knowledge and skill of the performer. Each strain has
its appropriate name, taken frequently from the name of the animal that
it is supposed to imitate.</p>

<p>Instrumental music, in general, is of minor tonality, melancholy,
weird, and suggestive in some ways of Chinese music.</p>

<p>Bamboo stampers are sometimes used to give more animation to a
dancing celebration, and bamboo sounders are attached to looms to draw
attention to the industry of the weaver.</p>

<p>Songs are always sung as solos. They are all extemporaneous and for
the most part legendary. The language is archaic and difficult for an
outsider to understand. The singing is a kind of declamation, with long
slurs, frequent staccatos, and abrupt endings. Of course, there are war
songs that demand loudness and rapidity, but on the whole the song music
is as weird and melancholy as the instrumental. Ceremonial chants do not
differ from secular songs, except that they treat of the doings of a
supernatural world, and are the medium through which supplications are
made to supernatural beings.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest of all social enjoyments, both for men and
deities, is the dance. It is performed by one person at a time. Men,
women and children take part. Dressed in a woman's skirt and decked out
in all obtainable finery, the dancer keeps perfect time to the rhythm of
the drum and the clang of the gong.</p>

<center>
<a name="1319"></a>
<h5>POLITICAL ORGANIZATION</h5>
</center>

<a name="13191"></a>
<p><i>System of government and social control</i>.--Manóboland is
divided into districts, more or less extensive, which are the property
of the different clans. Each district is under the nominal leadership of
the warrior chiefs and of the more influential men. In time of peace
these districts are open to everybody, but in time of war--and wars were
formerly very frequent--only persons of tried friendship are permitted
to enter.</p>

<p>A clan consists of a chief whose authority is merely nominal, and of
a number of his relatives varying from 20 to perhaps 200 souls. The
whole system is patriarchal, no coercion being used unless it is
sanctioned by the more influential members, approved by the consensus of
opinion of the people, and in accord with traditional custom.</p>

<p>The authority of the elder people is respected as long as they are
physically and mentally able to participate in public gatherings. Those
who have distinguished themselves by personal prowess always command a
following, but they have a greater influence in time of trouble than in
time of peace.</p>

<p>Perfect equality reigns among the members of the clan, except in the
one respect that the recognized warriors are entitled to the use of a
red headkerchief, jacket, and pantaloons, each of these articles,
beginning with the first, being added as the number of people whom the
warrior has killed is increased.</p>

<p>The chieftainship naturally falls to one who has attained the rank of
<i>bagáni</i>--that is, to one who has killed a certain number of
persons--provided he is otherwise sufficiently influential to attract a
following. His duties consist in lending his influence to settle
disputes and in redressing the wrongs of those who care to appeal to
him. As a priest he is thought to be under the protection of a war god
whose desire for blood he must satisfy.</p>

<p>The <i>bagáni</i> also acts as a medicine man, for he is reputed to
have certain magic powers both for good and for evil. The natural
secretiveness of the <i>bagáni</i> made it difficult for me to secure
much information on this point, but his power of harming at a distance
and of making himself invisible are matters of general belief. In his
character as a priest, he performs ceremonies for the cure of diseases
in which fluxes of blood occur.</p>

<a name="13192"></a>
<p><i>Methods of warfare</i>.--There is no military organization in
Manóboland. The greater part of those who form a war party are relatives
of the aggrieved one, though it is usual to induce some others of
acknowledged prowess to take part. No resentment is harbored by the
opposing party toward paid warriors.</p>

<p>Vendettas and debts are the most usual cause of war, and not, as has
been reported, glory and the capture of slaves. There is never wanting
on the part of those who originate the war a reasonable motive. The
vendetta system is not only recognized, but vengeance is considered
incumbent on the relatives of one who has been killed, and, as a
reminder, a piece of green rattan is sometimes strung up in the house.
The rattan suggests that until it rots the wrong will not be forgotten.
If the father is unable to avenge the wrong, he bequeathes[sic] the
revenge to his son as a sacred legacy. Sometimes another person is
deputed to take vengeance, in which case no blame is attached to him.</p>

<p>The peculiar custom prevails of killing a third party who may be
neutral, or of seizing his property, but I have known such an act to be
resented. As a result of this custom a war party returning from an
unsuccessful raid is dangerous.</p>

<p>There is usually no formal declaration of war. In fact, the greatest
secrecy is generally observed, and in urgent cases a body of ambushers
proceed at once to kill the first one of the enemy that happens to pass
their lurking place. As a rule, the enemy's house and his actions are
watched for weeks, perhaps for years, until a favorable opportunity for
attack presents itself.</p>

<p>The usual times for undertaking an expedition are during the rice
harvest and after a death. The preparation consists in acquiring a
thorough knowledge of the enemy's house and of its environment.
Everything being ready, the warriors assemble, a sacrifice is made,
omens are taken, and the band starts out at such an hour as will enable
them to reach the vicinity of the enemy about nightfall. From the last
stopping point a few warriors make a final reconnaissance in the gloom
of the night, release the enemy's traps, and return. The whole band,
numbering anywhere from 10 to 100, advance and, surrounding the house,
await the dawn, for it is at the first blush of the morning that sleep
is supposed to be heaviest. Moreover, there is then sufficient light to
enable the party to make the attack. Hence the peep of dawn is almost
always the hour of attack.</p>

<p>If the enemy's house is within spear reach, it is usually an easy
matter to put the inmates to death, but if it is a high house, and,
especially, if the inmates are well prepared, a warrior climbs up
silently under the house and spears one of them. This, followed by the
killing of pigs and by the battle cry, usually causes consternation. A
battle of arrows then takes place; there is a bandying of fierce
threats, taunts, and challenges, and the attacking party endeavors to
set the roof on fire with burning arrows. If they succeed the inmates
flee from the flames, but only the children, as a rule, escape the bolo
and the spear.</p>

<p>It is seldom that the attack is prolonged more than a few hours, and
it is seldom that the attack is unsuccessful, for if other means fail,
hunger and thirst will drive the besieged ones to flight, in which case
they become the victims of the besieging warriors. If one of the latter
is wounded or killed, the attack is abandoned at once, such an
occurrence being considered extremely inauspicious.</p>

<p>Each warrior gets credit for the number of people whom he kills, and
is entitled to the slaves that he may capture. The warrior chiefs open
the breasts of one or more of the headmen of the slain, insert a portion
of their charm collars into the openings, and consume the heart and
liver in honor of their war spirits.</p>

<p>During the return home the successful warriors make the forest
resound with the weird ululation of the battle cry, and adorn their
lances with palm fronds. Upon arrival at their settlement they are
welcomed with drum and song and loud acclaim. A purificatory bath is
followed by a feast in which each one recounts the minutest details of
the attack. After the feast some of the captives may be given to
warriors who were unlucky or who desire to satisfy their vengeance. The
captives are dispatched in the near-by forest.</p>

<p>Ambush is also a very ordinary method of warfare. Several warriors
station themselves in a selected position near the trail and await their
enemy.</p>

<p>Whenever there is open rupture between two parties, it is customary
for each of them to erect a high house in a place remote and difficult
of access, and to surround it with such obstacles as will make it more
dangerous. In these houses, with their immediate relatives and with such
warriors as desire to take their part, they bide their time in a state
of constant watch and ward.</p>

<p>When both parties to a feud are tired, either of fighting constantly
or of taking refuge in flight, a peacemaking may be brought about
through the good services of friendly and influential tribesmen. On the
appointed day, the parties meet, balance up their blood debts and other
obligations and decide on a term within which to pay them. As an
evidence of their sincere desire to preserve peace and to make mutual
restitution, a piece of green rattan is cut by the leaders, and a little
beeswax is burnt, both operations being symbolic of the fate that will
befall the one that breaks his plighted word.</p>

<p><i>Intertribal and analogous relations</i>.--Intertribal relations
between pagan Manóbos and Christtianized[sic] Manóbos, and between the
former and Bisáyas were comparatively pacific during my residence in the
Agúsan Valley. Between Manóbos and other mountain tribes, excepting
Mañgguáñgans, the relations were, with casual exceptions, rather
friendly, due, no doubt, to the lessons learned by the Manóbos in their
long struggles with Mandáyas, Banuáons, andv Debabáons up to the advent
of the missionaries about 1877. The Manóbos are inferior to the tribes
mentioned in tribal cohesion and in intellect. Their dealings, however,
with Mañgguáñgans, who are undoubtedly their physical and intellectual
inferiors, present a different aspect. With the Mandáyas and Debabáons,
they have helped to reduce the once extensive Mañgguáñgan tribe to the
remnant that it is to-day.</p>

<p>Manóbos and other mountain tribes have little to do with each other.
Only particular individuals of the various tribes, who have the happy
faculty of avoiding trouble, travel among other tribes. In general,
Manóbos are afraid of the aggressiveness of their neighbors (excluding
the Mañgguáñgans), and their neighbors f ear Manóbo instability and
hot-headedness; hence both sides pursue the prudent policy of
avoidance.</p>

<p>Interclan relations have been comparatively peaceful since the
establishment of the special government in the Agúsan Valley. Occasional
killings took place formerly and probably still take place in remote
regions, notably on the upper Baóbo. It is probable that since my
departure from the Agúsan in 1910 these murders take place much less
frequently, as the special government organized in 1907 has made great
headway in getting in contact with the more warlike people of the
interior.</p>

<p>Up to the time of my departure dealings between the various clans
were purely commercial and of a sporadic nature. Old enmities were not
forgotten, and it was considered more prudent to have as little as
possible to do with one another.</p>

<p>On all occasions, when there is any apprehension of danger, arms are
worn. During meals, even of festive occasions, the Manóbo eats with his
left hand, holding his right in readiness for an attack. The guests at a
feast are seated in such a way that an attack may be easily guarded
against. Various other laws of intercourse, such as those governing the
passing of one person behind another and method of unsheathing a bolo,
regulate the dealings of man with man and clan with clan.</p>

<p>Commercial relations between Bisáyas and Manóbos, both pagan and
Christianized, constitute, on the part of the first-mentioned, a system
of deliberate and nefarious spoliation which has been denounced from the
time of the first missionaries and which, by the establishment of
trading posts by the Government, eventually will be suppressed.
Absolutely inadequate values both in buying and selling commodities, use
of false weights and measures, defraudation in accounts, demands of
unspeakably high usury, wheedling by the <i>puának</i> or friendship
system, advancing of merchandise at exorbitant rates, especially just
before the rice harvest, and the system of commutation by which an
article not contracted for was accepted in payment though at a paltry
price--these were the main features of the system. It may be said that
the resultant and final gain amounted to between 500 and 1,000 per
cent.</p>

<p>The bartering was carried on in a spirit of dissimulation, the Manóbo
being cozened into the idea that the sale was an act of friendship and
involved a comparative loss on the part of the Bisáya. A period, more or
less extended, was allowed him wherein to complete the payment, with a
promise of further liberal advances.</p>

<p>Since the Manóbo has become aware of the stupendous gain of the
Bisáya, he is not so prompt in his payments and in fact often thwarts
his creditor by deliberate delays. Hence the frequent bickerings,
quarrels, and ill will that are ever a result of these commercial
relations.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that throughout the valley there was most undue
fluctuation of prices. Moreover, the Manóbo sold a part of his rice in
harvest time at 50 centavos a sack, and in time of scarcity repurchased
it at as much as 5 pesos.</p>

<p>The internal commerce of the Manóbos presents, on the whole, a very
different spectacle. It consists in simple exchanges. There is no
circulating medium. The units of exchange are slaves (valued at from 15
to 30 pesos each), pigs, and plates, but with the exception of the
first, these units are not constant in value.</p>

<p>The measures used are the <i>gántang</i>, a cylindrical wooden vessel
with a capacity of from 10 to 15 liters; the <i>kabán</i>,<sup>1</sup>
which contains 25 gántang; the yard, measured from the end of the thumb
to the middle of the sternum; the span, the fathom, the finger, and the
finger joint.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Called also <i>bákid</i> and <i>anéga</i>. A <i>kabán</i>
is measured by counting out 25 <i>gántang</i>.</p>

<p>Slavery is a recognized institution, but since the diminution of
intertribal and interclan wars the number of slaves has diminished.
Slaves were originally obtained by capture and then passed from hand to
hand in making marriage payments. It sometimes occurs, in an exigency,
that a man delivers a child, even his own, into captivity.</p>

<p>The slave is generally not ill-treated but has to do all the work
that is assigned to him. He has no rights of any kind, possesses no
property except a threadbare suit, and is usually not allowed to marry.
However, he receives a sufficiency of food and seems to be contented
with his lot.</p>

<a name="131A"></a>
<h5>ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE</h5>
</center>

<a name="131A1"></a>
<p><i>General principles and various laws</i>.--It is frequently stated
by Bisáyas and others that Manóbo justice consists in the oppression of
the weak by the strong, but I have not found this to be true. The Manóbo
is too independent and too much a lover of revenge to brook coercion. He
recognizes a set of customary rules, and any departure from them is
resented by himself and by his relatives.</p>

<p>Nearly all violations of rights are considered as civil and not as
criminal wrongs, and upon due compensation are condoned. Failure on the
part of the offender to make this compensation leads the aggrieved man
and his relatives to take justice into their own hands.</p>

<p>The guilty one in nearly every case is allowed a fair and impartial
hearing in the presence of his own relatives. The matter is argued out,
witnesses are called, and the offender's own relatives generally exert
their influence to make him yield with good will. Hence the feast that
follows nearly every case of successful arbitration.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental customs of the Manóbos is to regard as a duty
the payment of one's debts, and this duty is performed sacredly and
often at a sacrifice. Another fundamental custom is the right of
revenge. Revenge is a sacred duty that is bequeathed from generation to
generation, and from it result the long and terrible feuds that have
devastated Manóboland.</p>

<p>Customary law is based on the intense conservation of the Manóbo,
fostered by the priests and strengthened by a system of religious
injunctions and interdictions. Anyone who violates these taboos or
interdictions becomes liable for all evil consequences that may
follow.</p>

<p>Property rights are understood and rigidly upheld, so much so that
there seems to be no conception of a gift as such. Large tracts of land
are considered the property of a clan, but anyone on good terms with the
clan may settle on the land and may have all the rights of a clansman
except those of fishing. Each individual becomes the temporary owner of
the land that he selects and of the crops that he plants thereon. As
soon as he abandons the land it becomes the collective property of the
clan. Land disputes are unknown.</p>

<p>Property that is the result of one's labor or one's purchase belongs
to the individual except in the case of women, children, and slaves.
Loss of and damage to property belonging to another must be made good,
no excuses being admitted.</p>

<p>The law of contracts is stringent, but a certain amount of
consideration is shown in case of a failure to fulfill a contract on
time, unless a definite stipulation to the contrary has been previously
made. All contracts are made in the presence of witnesses, and
frequently a knotted rattan slip, representing the number of items or
the number of days to elapse before payment, is delivered by the one who
makes the contract.</p>

<p>Nearly all transactions are made on a credit basis, hence frequent
disputes arise out of the failure of one party or the other to fulfill
the terms of the contract. The failures are sometimes due to the fact
that one individual man depends on payment from another in order to
satisfy his debt to a third party. Undue delay on the part of a debtor
finally gives the creditor the right to seize the property of the
debtor, or even the property of a third party. Such an action is not
common and is always taken under the stress of exasperation after
repeated efforts to collect have proved unavailing. As a rule the
relatives of the debtor prefer to settle the obligation rather than to
allow matters to become too serious, but it happens at times that they,
too, are obstinate and allow things to take their course.</p>

<p>No interest is charged on loans except in the case of paddy. There
are few loans made, and no leases or pledges. These last imply a
distrust that is not pleasing to the Manóbo.</p>

<p>The law of liability is very strict. For instance, if one should ask
another to accompany him on a journey and the latter should fall sick or
die, the former would be liable for his death. If one should die in the
house, thereby causing the abandonment of it, the relatives of the dead
man would have to pay the value of the house. Similar instances are of
frequent occurrence and can readily be understood. This liability law
extends to evils supposed to be due to the violation of taboos and to
the possession of magic powers.</p>

<p>There is a system of fining that serves, harsh though it may seem, to
maintain proper deference to the person and the property of another.
Thus, spitting on another, rudely grasping another's person, entering
another's district without due permission, bathing in river without the
owner's leave, are a few of the many cases that might be adduced. The
fine varies according to the damage and amount of malice that may be
proved in the subsequent arbitration.</p>

<a name="131A2"></a>
<p><i>Regulations governing domestic relations and property; customary
procedure in settlements of disputes.</i>--The house belongs
collectively to the builders. The property in it belongs to the male
inmates who have acquired it.</p>

<p>The elder brother takes possession of the property of his deceased
brother, unless the eldest son of the deceased is of such an age as to
be capable of managing the household. In case the deceased did not have
a brother, a brother-in-law or a son-in-law becomes the representative
of the household. The eldest son inherits his father's debts and must
pay them.</p>

<p>There is so little property in the ordinary Manóbo home that there
are no disputes as to the inheritance. After a death the house is
abandoned and the grief-stricken relatives scurry off with their
baskets, mats, and simple utensils to make another home in a solitary
part of the forest.</p>

<p>The relations both prenuptial and postnuptial between the sexes are
of the strictest kind. All evil conduct from adultery down to immodest
gazing is punished with appropriate fines and even with death. The fines
vary from the equivalent of three slaves down to the equivalent of a few
pesos.</p>

<p>The marriage contract is very rigid. I know of few cases in which the
stipulated price was not paid prior to the delivery of the fiancé. In
case of the death of one of the affiancéd parties, the payments made
must be refunded. In case of the refusal of the bridegroom to continue
his suit even though there has been no fault on the part of the bride or
of her relatives, he loses all right to recover. Should the bride's
people, however, decide to discontinue the proceedings, they must return
the previous payments and make, I believe, compensation for the trouble
and expenses incurred during the previous transactions. No case of a
discontinuance of the marriage proceedings ever passed under my
observation.</p>

<p>The father has theoretically full power over his wife and children,
but in practice his domestic jurisdiction is of the most lenient kind.
Marital affection and filial devotion reign in the household.</p>

<p>The husband may not marry a second wife during the lifetime of the
first without the latter's consent. This rule, as well as the lack of
sufficient worldly possessions to purchase another helpmate, makes
polygamy comparatively infrequent.</p>

<p>The bridegroom is supposed to live with his father-in-law or with the
previous owner of his wife, very often his wife's brother, but nearly
always sets up his own establishment a few years after marriage.</p>

<p>With the exception of adultery, fornication, rape, and wanton
homicide, all crimes presuppose an appeal to arbitration. The one that
is the author of another's death is the one on whom vengeance must be
taken, if it is possible.</p>

<p>When an outraged party is unable to obtain redress by arbitration or
by the direct reprisal, he avenges himself on a third party, preferably
a relative of his enemy, by killing him or by seizing his property. He
thus brings matters to a head. It is usual to compound with the
relatives of this third party, either for the death or for the seizure,
on condition that they will league themselves with the one who is
seeking revenge, in opposition to the original wrongdoer or that they
themselves will undertake, as his paid agents, to wreak vengeance on his
enemy.</p>

<p>Minor offenses are punished by fines that are determined by
arbitration. These fines vary in amount, but nearly always include a
feast, more or less elaborate, the expenses of which are borne by the
party that lost the case.</p>

<p>The arbitration of a question may be made immediately after it has
arisen or it may not be brought about for weeks or months. When the
discussion has begun it is not considered politic for either side to
yield at once. Threats are bandied between the principals until, through
the influence of friendly chiefs, they are brought together. Then the
relatives discuss the affair, each side exaggerating its own view of the
question. It is only after lengthy discussions, and the use of
similitudes and allegories, loud shouts, dissimulation, and through the
sagacity and influence of the chief men that the opinions of the parties
are so molded that an agreement is reached.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to determine the offense. This is done by
witnesses who give, as far as I have been able to judge, truthful
testimony. Whenever the veracity of a witness is doubted he may be
obliged to take a kind of oath which consists in the burning of beeswax.
A little beeswax is melted by holding a firebrand over it. While this is
being done, the person whose veracity it is desired to test, utters a
wish that in case of falsehood his body may be melted like the wax. In
the case of suspects, ordeals are employed. They consist of making the
parties under suspicion either plunge their hands into boiling water, or
undergo the diving test, or take the candle ordeal.</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence is admissible. By means of it, the authors of
hidden crimes are often brought to punishment after years of patient
waiting.</p>

<p>It is customary for the guilty one to make at least a partial payment
immediately after the arbitration, and to treat the assembly to a
banquet in which it is good form for the two opponents to close the
breaches of friendship by generous quaffs to each other's health.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<h3>RELIGIOUS IDEAS AND MENTAL CHARACTERISTICS IN GENERAL</h3>

<a name="141"></a>
<h4>A BRIEF SURVEY OF RELIGION</h4>
</center>

<p>A study of Manóbo religion is difficult because of the natural
secretiveness and suspiciousness of this primitive man, because of his
dependence for his religious ideas on his priests, because of the
variations and apparent contradictions that arise at every step, and,
finally, because of his inability to expound in a satisfactory manner
the beliefs of his religious system.</p>

<center>
<a name="1411"></a>
<h5>THE BASIS, INFLUENCE, AND MACHINERY OF RELIGION</h5>
</center>

<p>The religious belief of the Manóbo is an essential part of his life.
On his person he often carries religious objects. The site for his home
is not selected till omens and oracles are consulted. In his method of
cooking there are religious rules. He can not procure his meat from the
forest nor his fish from the streams without making an appropriate
offering. He sows and harvests his rice under the auspices of certain
deities. His hunting dogs are under the protection of a special
divinity. His bolo and his spear must answer a special magic test. He
can not go forth to fight till divination and sacrifice have assured him
success. All the great events of his life--his marriage, the
pregnacy[sic] and parturition of his wife, death, burial, war--all are
consecrated by formal, and often public, religious rites.</p>

<p>As far as I have been able to judge, fear of the deities of evil
spirits, of the dead--of all that is unintelligible, unusual, somber--is
the mainspring of the Manóbos religious observances and beliefs.</p>

<p>In order to detect the evils, natural and supernatural, to which he
may be exposed, he has recourse to dreams, divination, auguries, and
omens, and, in more serious cases he calls upon his priests to ascertain
by invocation, oblation, and sacrifice, the source of the evil that has
befallen him, or of the danger that he fears.</p>

<center>
<a name="1412"></a>
<h5>THE HIERARCHY OF MANÓBO DIVINITIES, BENEFICENT AND MALIGNANT</h5>
</center>

<p>There is no supreme being in the Manóbo pantheon, though there are
two principal classes of beneficent divinities. Little is known of one
of these classes beyond its supposed existence. The other class is made
up of humanlike deities called <i>diwáta</i> that retain a fondness for
this world and the good things thereof. They select mortals for their
favorites, and through them keep themselves provided with such earthly
delicacies as they may desire, even though they may have to plague their
mortal votaries in order to secure them.</p>

<p>There is another category of spirits, of a slightly different
character, whose desire is blood. These are the war divinities that
select certain individuals for their champions and urge them on to deeds
of valor, with the hope of procuring blood.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to the above divinities are others of a
malignant or dangerous character. Chief among them are the <i>búsau</i>,
black, hideous spirits that dwell in dark, desolate places, and who are
for the most part implacable enemies of man. To counteract the
machinations of these spirits, the beneficent dieties[sic] are called
upon by Manóbo priests and feasted with song and dance and sacrifice.
Pleased with these tokens of friendship, the good spirits pursue the
evil ones, and even engage in battle with them.</p>

<p>The <i>tagbánua</i> are a class of local spirits that reign over the
forest tracts and mountains. They are not of an unkindly nature as long
as a certain amount of respect is paid them. Hence the practice of
making offerings during hunting and other forest occupations.</p>

<p>Among the other inimical spirits are: The rice pilferer,
<i>Dágau</i>; <i>Anit</i>, the thunderbolt spirit; numerous epidemic
demons; the goddess of consanguineous love and marriage; the spirit of
sexual excess; the wielder of the lightning and the manipulator of the
winds and storms; the cloud spirit; and various others.</p>

<p>Agricultural and hunting operations are all performed under the
auspices of gods and goddesses. Thus <i>Hakiádan</i> and <i>Taphágan</i>
take care of the rice during sowing and harvest time, respectively;
<i>Tagamáling</i> attends to other crops; <i>Libtákan</i> is the god of
sunshine and good weather; and <i>Sugújun</i> is the god of the
chase.</p>

<p>There are other gods: <i>Mandáit</i>, the birth deity; <i>Ibú</i>,
the goddess of the afterworld; <i>Makalídung</i>, the founder of the
world; <i>Manduyápit</i>, the ferryman; and <i>Yúmud</i>, the water
wraith.</p>

<center>
<a name="1413"></a>
<h5>PRIESTS----THEIR FUNCTIONS, ATTRIBUTES, AND EQUIPMENT</h5>
</center>

<p>The performance of nearly all the greater religious rites is left to
the priests who are of two classes--<i>bailán</i> or ordinary priests,
and <i>bagáni</i> or war priests. It is the prerogative of these priests
to hold communication with their familiar spirits; to find out from them
their desires; to learn the doings of the unfriendly spirits, and the
means to be taken for a mitigation of the evil in question.</p>

<p>The ordinary priests are simple intermediaries, claiming no wondrous
powers, making use of no deceptive nor mercenary methods, as far as my
observation goes, with no particular dress and little paraphernalia,
having no political influence, but possessing, in all that concerns
religion, paramount authority. Their title to priesthood is derived from
violent manifestations, such as trembling, perspiring, belching,
semiunconsciousness, that are believed to be a result of communication
with their familiars.</p>

<p>The war priests have blood spirits for their favorites, and
accordingly perform their rites only in matters that concern war and
wounds.</p>

<p>Ceremonial accessories consist of a few heirlooms, a small altar
house, a wooden oblation tray, a one-legged stand, a sacrificial table,
ceremonial decorations, sacred images, and sacrificial offerings.</p>

<p>The religious rites peculiar to the ordinary priests, consist of
betel-nut offerings, the burning of incense, invocations, prophylactic
fowl waving, omen taking, blood unction, the child ceremony, the death
feast, the rice-planting ceremony, the hunting rite, and the sacrifice
of pig or fowl.</p>

<p>The ceremonies peculiar to the warrior priests, besides the betel-nut
tribute to the war spirits and invocation offered to them, are:
Invocation and offerings to the spirit companions or &#34;souls&#34; of
the living enemy, special forms of divination connected with war, a
special invocation to the omen bird preparatory to the war raid,
placation and propitiation of the tutelary war deities by invocation, by
sacrifice, and ceremonial cannibalism; and, probably, in the remote
districts, by human sacrifice.</p>

<center>
<a name="1414"></a>
<h5>THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF MANÓBO RELIGION</h5>
</center>

<p>The main features, then, of the Manóbo religious system are:</p>

<blockquote><p>(1) A firm traditional belief in the existence of
anthropomorphic beneficent deities that will help the Manóbo if he
supplies them with the offerings they desire, but, if not, that will
allow and even cause evil to befall him.</p>

<p>(2) A belief in the existence of forest spirits and sky spirits, who
on occasions may become hostile and must be propitiated.</p>

<p>(3) An absolute reliance on priests, who are the favorites of one or
more of the friendly divinities, and through whose mediation he secures
their good will and assistance.</p>

<p>(4) The fear of the dead who are thought to harbor an envious feeling
toward the living.</p>

<p>(5) The frequent consultation or interpretation of omens, auguries,
and oracles for ascertaining future events.</p>

<p>(6) A rigid adherence to a numerous set of taboos, some based on
religious ideas, some founded on sympathetic magic.</p>

<p>(7) A frequent application of the principle of sympathetic magic by
which one act is believed to be productive of a correlated result.</p>

<p>(8) A conscientious avoidance of everything disrespectful in word and
act toward one of the brute creation.</p>

<p>(9) A belief in two spirit companions that accompany each mortal from
birth till death.</p>

<p>(10) A belief in the possibility of capture of one of these spirit
companions by malignant spirits.</p>

<p>(11) A universal and constant faith in the existence of an afterworld
and of the eternal survival of at least one spirit companion therein.</p>

<p>(12) A belief in dreams as being often indicative of future evil.</p>

<p>(13) A belief in secret methods that may be productive of harm to
others.</p>

<p>(14) The recourse to oaths and ordeals for the enforcement of
promises and for the determination of truth.</p>

<p>(15) The unmistakable apotheosis of bravery as illustrated by the
warlike character of one class of deities.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such are the main characteristics of this form of primitive religion.
The peculiar fear, entertained by its lowly votary, of lonely mountains,
odd-shaped rocks, gloomy caves and holes, hot springs and similar
formations of nature; his belief that planted things have
&#34;souls&#34; and his peculiar respect for animals and insects--these
and minor manifestations may point perhaps to a former nature and animal
worship, but at present there is no indication of such. The Manóbo's
conduct in the presence of such objects and phenomena is one of fear
toward, and placation of, the agencies which he believes produce the
phenomena or of the spirit owners of the objects that come across his
path. It is to them alone that he pays his respect, and not to the
material object or manifestation that has become the object of his
perception.</p>

<p>Though one of the characteristics of Manóbo religion is the
apotheosis of bravery, as is apparent from the warlike character of the
divinities, and from the general desire to die the death of the slain,
yet I find little trace of ancestor worship. The dead are feared, their
burial place is shunned, their character is deemed perfidious, and
relations with them are terminated by a farewell mortuary feast, after
which it is expected that they will depart, to vex the living no
more.</p>

<center>
<a name="142"></a>
<h4>MENTAL AND OTHER ATTAINMENTS AND CHARACTERISTICS</h4>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo's intellectual attainments are very limited. He counts on
his fingers and on his toes, or by means of material objects such as
grains of maize. He has never had any system of writing and does not
know how to read. His &#34;letters&#34; and his &#34;contracts&#34; are
material objects in the shape of bolos and other things, sent from one
person to another with a verbal message, or strips of rattan with knots.
His method of counting is decimal, and comprehends all numbers up to a
hundred, though I am inclined to think that this last number represents
to him infinity.</p>

<p>The reckoning of time is equally simple. The day is divided into day
and night, the hour being indicated by stretching out the arm and open
hand in the direction of that part of the sky where the sun or the moon
would be at the time it is desired to indicate.</p>

<p>The month is not divided into weeks but the lunar month itself is
carefully followed, each phase of the moon having its distinct name,
though it is only in the case of the extreme of each phase that they
agree on its name.</p>

<p>Years are reckoned by the recurrence of the rice-harvesting season,
which varies according to the climate and geographical position of
different regions. It is seldom that one can count backwards more than
four or five years unless he can help his memory by some event such as
an earthquake, and extra heavy flood, the arrival of the Spanish
missionaries, the Philippine insurrection, or the growth of trees, but
as a rule no attempt is made to determine the number of years that have
elapsed since any event. I have seldom met a Manóbo who had any idea as
to his age, or any ability to judge approximately of the age of
another.</p>

<p>Historical knowledge is confined almost entirely to events that have
occured[sic] within one's lifetime. There are few traditions that have
any historical value, and even in these there is an element of the
wonderful that makes them unreliable as guides.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the pagan Manóbo has made no advance along
academic lines, clue to the fact that he never has had an opportunity
afforded him, but judging of his intellectual ability by that of the
Christianized Manóbos, it is not inferior to that of the Bisáya. I had
experience in organizing and conducting schools among the
<i>conquistas</i>, and it has been my experience that <i>ceteris
paribus</i>, they advance as rapidly as Bisáyas. If the
<i>conquistas</i> have not progressed as far intellectually, it is due
to lack of facilities and not to any inherent inability to learn.</p>

<p>Knowledge of astronomy is limited among the Manóbos to the names of a
few of the principal stars and constellations. The nature of the stars,
moon, sun, eclipses, and kindred phenomena are all explained in
mythological tales, from a belief in which no amount of reasoning can
move them. The old story that the comet is the harbinger or bearer of
disease is in vogue.</p>

<p>Esthetic arts, such as painting and architecture, are unknown, though
Manóbos can carve rude and often fantastic wooden images, and can make
crude tracings and incisions on lime tubes and baskets.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their lack of scientific and esthetic knowledge,
their observation of nature is marvelous. This is obviously due to long
familiarity with the forest, the stream, and the mountains. From his
boyhood years the Manóbo has lived the life of the forest. He has
scanned the trees for birds and monkeys, the streams for fish. Living,
as he generally has, within a definite district, and roaming over it in
search of game and other things to eat, at the same time keeping a close
watch for any variation that might indicate the presence of an outsider,
he has come to possess those marvelous powers of sight and of
observation that would astonish the average white man. Within his own
district the position of every tree is known. Every stream and every
part of it, every mountain, every part of the forest is known and has
its appropriate name. The position of a place is explained in a few
words to a fellow tribesman, and is understood by the latter.</p>

<p>Trees and plants are recognized, and their adaptation in a great many
cases for certain economic uses is known, though I think that, in his
knowledge of the latter, the Manóbo is inferior to both the Bisáya and
the Mandáya, as he is undoubtedly of a more conservative and less
enterprising disposition.</p>

<p>The Manóbo character has been so maligned by missionaries, and by all
the Bisáyas who have dealings with them, that it deserves a clearance
from the aspersions that have been cast upon it. In dealing with the
Manóbo, as with all primitive peoples, the personal equation brings out
more than anything else the good qualities that underlie his character.
Several of the missionaries seem not to have distinguished between the
pagan and the man. To them the pagan was the incarnation of all that is
vile, a creature whose every act was dictated by the devil. The Bisáya
regarded him somewhat in the same light, but went further. He looked
upon him as his enemy because of the many acts of retribution, even
though retribution was merited, that had been committed by the Manóbo or
by his ancestors. He entertained a feeling of chagrin and disappointment
that this primitive man was unwilling to become an absolute tool in his
hands for thorough exploitation. Hence no name, however vile, was too
bad for the poor forest dweller who refused to settle near his
plantation and toil--man, woman, and child--for an utterly inadequate
wage. His feeling toward the <i>conquistas</i> is little, if at all,
better.</p>

<p>Upon first acquaintance the Manóbo is timid and suspicious. This is
due to the extreme cautiousness that teaches him to guard a life that
among his own people has only a nominal value. When in the presence of
strangers for the first time, he remembers that reprisals have been
bandied from time immemorial between his people on the one hand, and
Bisáyas, on the other, and he realizes that without proper care,
reprisals might be made on him. Again, if the visitor has penetrated
into his district, his suspicion may be aroused to its full force by
calumnious reports or rumors that may have preceded the visitor's
arrival. My own visits were frequently preceded by rumors to the effect
that I had magic power to poison or to do other things equally
wonderful, that I was a solider in disguise, or by other similar
reports. But in these cases and in all others one may allay the
timorousness and suspiciousness of these primitive people to a great
extent by previous announcement of one's visit and intentions, and upon
arrival in their settlement, by refraining from any act or word that
might betray one's curiosity. Surprise must not be expressed at anything
that takes place. The mere question as to what, for instance, is beyond
such and such a mountain, or where is the headwaters of such and such a
stream, may start up the full flame of suspicion. Hence prudence, a
kind, quiet, but alert manner, a good reputation from the last visited
locality and a distribution of trifling gifts, is always efficacious in
removing that feeling of distrust that these primitive people feel
toward a stranger.</p>

<p>Another charge is that they are revengeful. They certainly believe in
&#34;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&#34; Revenge for an
unatoned wrong is a stern, fundamental, eternal law, sanctioned by
Manóbo institutions, social, political, and religious; one that is
consecrated by the breath of the dying, and passed on from generation to
generation to be fulfilled; but it has one saving clause,
<i>arbitration</i>. Hence a stranger must inform himself of such past
happenings as might jeopardize him. The Manóbo has a very limited
conception of the extent of the outside world and of the number of its
inhabitants, and he is inclined to believe that one American, for
instance, knows every other one and may be related by blood to any
other. Hence any imprudent action on the part of one may draw down
revenge on the head of another<sup>1</sup>, relative or not, for even
innocent third parties may, by Manóbo custom, be sacrificed to the
unsatisfied spirit of revenge. The danger, however, in which a stranger
might find himself from this cause, is easily eliminated by questioning
the people as to who had wronged them on previous occasions; and should
he learn that he is considered a party to the wrong through identity of
blood or of race with the guilty one, he must gently suggest a plan for
arbitration at some later date, and in other pacific ways avert the
revenge from himself.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>It is not improbable that the death of Mr. H. M. Ickis,
geologist of the Bureau of Science, Manila, was partly due to the
capture and exile of one Gubat of the upper Umaíam some 15 or 20 years
ago.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, affirmed that Manóbos are treacherous. If by
treachery is meant a violation of faith and confidence, they can not be
said to be treacherous. They kill when they feel that they are wronged.
I know of few cases where they did not openly avow their feelings and
demand reparation. Refusal to make the reparation demanded is equivalent
to a declaration of war, and in war all is fair. It is every man's duty
to safeguard himself as best he can. The Manóbo, Mandáya, Mañgguáñgan,
and Debabáon houses erected in strategic positions throughout the
interior of eastern Mindanáo, bear witness to the fact that these people
recognize the principle that all is fair in war. The fact that they
frequently carry their spears and shields when on the trail, and in time
of trouble accompany their womenfolk to the farms and guard them there,
is sufficient evidence of the fact that every means must be taken to
safeguard one's self and interests from an enemy. But let a case be once
arbitrated, and beeswax burned or other solemn manifestation of
agreement be made, and it is my opinion that the pledge will not, as a
rule, be broken.</p>

<p>Cowardice is a trait attributed to Manóbos and other people of
Mindanáo. It is true that they do not take inordinate risks. The
favorite hour for attack on an enemy's house is dawn. They prefer to
thrust a spear through the floor rather than to call the enemy out to
fight a hand-to-hand battle. In other cases they prefer to ambush him on
the trail, 5 or 10 men against 1. Again, it may be more convenient to
pick off a lone woman in a <i>camote</i> patch. Such are recognized
methods of warfare. Once aroused, however, the Manóbo will fight, and
fight to a finish. Throughout the Jesuit letters we find mentioned
various instances of really brave deeds on the part of Manóbos. In some
cases the husband killed his family and then himself rather than fall
into the hands of the Spanish troops. I have been informed of hundreds
of instances in which the male members of the attacked party threw
themselves against superior numbers in order that their wives might
escape. Hand-to-hand encounters are not uncommon, if I may believe the
endless stories that have been narrated to me by warriors throughout
eastern Mindanáo.</p>

<p>Laziness and dilatoriness can certainly be predicated of Manóbo men,
but such qualities are to be attributed to lack of incentive to work and
to hurry. All the household duties fall, by custom, upon the shoulders
of the women, so that there is little left for the man except to fish,
hunt, trap, trade, and fight. When, however, the men set themselves to
clearing the forest or to other manual tasks, it is surprising with what
agility, skill, and perseverance they work, though such spells of labor
are short lived.</p>

<p>No one has ever uttered or written a word against the Manóbo's sexual
morality. It is true that sexual matters are discussed with the greatest
freedom, but the most venial breaches of morality are punished. The
greatest modesty is observed in regard to the exposure of the private
parts. Gazing at an undressed woman, for instance, at the bathing place
results in a fine. Unseemly insinuations to a woman are visited with a
similar punishment, but should such overtures go further, even death may
be the penalty.</p>

<p>As to temperance and sobriety, the rule is to eat and drink all one
can, hence the amount of food and drink consumed depends upon the
supply. Sobriety is not a virtue. To lose one's equilibrium and senses
is to do honor to the host and justice to his generosity.</p>

<p>Honesty is certainly a trait of the Manóbo character. I do not mean
to maintain that there are not occasional pilferings, especially in
small things that are considered to be more or less communal in their
nature, such as palm wine while still flowing from the tree, but other
kinds of property are perfectly safe. The rare violations of the rule of
honesty are punished more or less severely according to the amount of
the property stolen and according to other considerations.</p>

<p>Though respect for another's property is decidedly the rule, yet it
is surprising to note with what care everything is counted, tied up, or
put away, and how marks of ownership are set up on all occasions. I
think, however, that these precautions are due not so much to a fear of
pilferers as to a feeling of the instability of conditions in a country
that has always been subject to turmoil.</p>

<p>Honesty in the payment of debts is one of the most striking
characteristics of these people. I have advanced merchandise on credit
to people whom I had never met before and the whereabouts of whose
houses I did not know except from their own information, and yet, six
months or a year later, when I entered their region I had no difficulty
in locating them nor in collecting from them. So high is their feeling
of obligation to pay a debt that even children are sometimes parted with
in settlement, but this occurs in extreme cases only. Though debts are
satisfied conscientiously, yet a certain amount of consideration is
expected as to the time and other details of payment, except in some
very urgent cases.</p>

<p>Honesty in other matters, as in the performance of formal agreements,
is equally noticeable though I must say that the performance may not be
as prompt in point of time as we would expect. But it must be
remembered, in connection with this last point, that in making an
agreement one is presumed to make allowance for a great many
impediments, such as evil omens, that do not figure in our system of
contracts. Another difference, which applies also to the matter of
debts, is that the man who owes a debt must be reminded of his
obligation and urged in a gentle way to the performance of it. It occurs
in some rare instances that a debtor is under a definite contract as to
the exact time for meeting his obligation. In these cases the creditor
may be more insistent upon payment. It is to the credit of the Manóbo
that he never disowns a debt nor runs away to avoid the payment
thereof.</p>

<p>It has been said that the Manóbo is ungrateful, but I do not think
that his gratitude is so rare nor so transitory a virtue as is claimed
by those who pretend to know him. It is true that he has no word to
express thanks, but he expects the giver to make known his desires and
ask for what he wants. This is the reason why he himself is such an
inveterate beggar. He receives you into his house, feeds you, considers
you his friend, and proceeds to make you reciprocate by asking for
everything he sees. If he is under any obligation to you, he expects you
to ask in a similar manner. If you do not do it, he considers you either
apathetic or rich, and hence no reciprocation is forthcoming. Among
Manóbos no presents are made except of such trifles as have no value.</p>

<p>The Manóbo feels that he is at perfect liberty to conceal his real
thoughts and to give utterance to such distortions of truth as may not
compromise him with others. The penalty for slander is so great that
this is a fault that is seldom committed. Hence to get the truth from a
Manóbo, it is useless, as a rule, to question him singly or even in the
presence of his friends alone. He must be brought face to face with
those who hold an adverse opinion or belong to an opposite faction. If
this can be done, in a more formal way, as for example, by having a
number of principal men attend, it will be so much the easier to obtain
the desired information.</p>

<p>Queries as to trails or the dwelling places of neighboring Manóbos
are hardly ever answered truthfully and do more harm than good, because
they tend to arouse suspicions as to the questioner's motives. Such
information is obtained more readily by cultivating the friendship of
boys than by consulting the older folks. This tendency to disguise or to
distort the truth, though it has its natural basis in a desire for
self-protection, gives the Manóbos a reputation for lack of that
straightforwardness and frankness that is so noticeable among the
Mandáyas, even after very short acquaintance. This lack of frankness,
coupled with a certain amount of natural shrewdness, makes the truth
difficult to discover, unless the suggestion made before be carried out,
or unless one is willing to wait till the truth leaks out in private
conversation among the Manóbos themselves.</p>

<p>One trait of the Manóbo that seems hard to understand is his love for
long discussions. No matter how trifling the matter may be, it always
becomes the subject of an inordinately long conference even though there
are no dissenting parties. Even in such trifles as getting a guide to
take me, by well-known trails, to settlements of people with whom I was
well acquainted, the inevitable discussion would always take place. A
great number of people would assemble. The matter would be discussed at
length by every one present without a single interruption, except such
exclamations of assent as are continuously uttered whether the speaker's
views are acceptable or not. It seems that these and more solemn
discussions afford the speakers an opportunity to make themselves
conspicuous or to display their judgment. I can divine no other reason
for these conferences because, in many cases that I have known, the
result of the discussion was a foregone conclusion from the beginning.
Perhaps such discussions are for the purpose of &#34;making no
concessions&#34; or if they must be made, of making them
begrudgingly.</p>

<p>These conferences are as a rule rather noisy, for though one speaker
at a time &#34;has the floor,&#34; there are always a number of
collateral discussions, that, joined to the invariable household sounds,
produce somewhat of a din. Noise, in fact, is a general characteristic
of Manóbo life, so much so that at times one is inclined to be alarmed
at the loud yelling and other demonstrations of apparent excitement,
even though the occasion for it all may be nothing more than the arrival
in the settlement of a visitor with a dead monkey.</p>

<p>Harmony and domestic happiness are characteristic of the Manóbo
family. The Manóbo is devoted to his wife, fond of his children, and
attached to his relatives, more so than the Mañgguáñgan, but much less
so than the Bisáya or the Mandáya. He is dearly fond of social
gatherings for, besides the earthly comforts that he gets out of them,
they afford him an opportunity to display such wealth, rank, and
possessions as he may possess. His invitations to neighbors serve to
keep him high in their estimation and thereby gather around him a number
of friends who will be of service in the hour of trouble. Of the Manóbo,
as of the other people of Mindanáo, too much can not be said of his
hospitality. If he has once overcome his suspicions as to a stranger's
motives, he takes him into his house and puts himself to infinite pains
to feast him as best he knows how. In Manóboland one who travels carries
no provisions. He drops into the first house and when the meal hour
arrives he sits down upon the floor and helps himself without any
invitation. It is practically his own house, because for the time being
he becomes one of the family. If there happens to be a feast, he
partakes without any special invitation, and when he is ready to go, he
proceeds upon his journey, only to repeat the operation in the next
house, for it is customary always to pay at least a short visit to every
friendly house on or near the trail.</p>

<p>One of the mental traits that has perhaps done more than anything
else to retard the Manóbo in his progress towards a higher plane of
civilization is his firm adherence to traditional customs. All things
must be done as his forefathers did them. Innovations of any kind may
displease the deities, may disturb the present course of events, may
produce future disturbances. &#34;Let the river flow as it ever
flowed--to the sea,&#34; is a refrain that I heard quoted on this
subject by Manóbos. &#34;Fish that live in the sea do not live in the
mountains,&#34; is another, and there are many others, all illustrating
that conservatism that tends to keep the Manóbo a Manóbo and nothing
else. He is Christianized but, after going through the Christian ritual,
he will probably invoke his pagan divinities. He takes on something new
but does not relinquish the old. Hence the difficulty of inducing the
Manóbo to leave the district of his forefathers, and take up his abode
in a new place amid unfamiliar spirits.</p>

<p>This feature of their character explains the inconstancy and
fickleness exhibited by the Christianized Manóbos at the beginning of
their conversion. These were due to the call of the forest hailing them
back to their old haunts. These characteristics will explain also a host
of anomalies that are noticeable throughout the Manóbo's life.</p>

<p>The first visit of a stranger to a primitive settlement may produce
upon him a very unfavorable impression. He may find that the women and
children have fled, so that he finds himself surrounded by men, all
armed. This should not discourage him, as it happens in many cases that
the men were unable to keep the women from flight. The wearing of arms
is as much a custom with Manóbos as the wearing of a watch is with us.
The bolo is his life and his livelihood. Were he not to wear it he would
be branded as insane, and he looks upon a defenseless person, stranger
or otherwise, much in the same light, unless he attributes the absence
of a weapon to the possession of secret powers of protection, in which
case he is inclined to follow the example of the fugitive women and
betake himself beyond the reach of harm.</p>

<p>Upon first acquaintance the Manóbo will ask a host of questions that
will tax the patience of the visitor if he ventures to answer them
personally. These questions spring from a desire to learn the motives of
the visit. People from the neighboring houses drop in at intervals just
as soon as word reaches them of the new arrival, and may continue to do
so until the time of the visitor's departure, thereby keeping the house
crowded. The assembling of these people arises from a desire to see the
visitor and to find out the object of his visit. Hence the newcomers
will proceed to ask him every imaginable question that may suggest
itself and if any answer conveys information that has anything of the
wonderful in it for them, it gives rise to a thousand and one other
questions, the responses to which often tax a visitor's patience.</p>

<p>Another part of the visit is the frank demand on the part of the
primitive people for any object of the visitor which they may take a
fancy to. They always understand, however, a quiet refusal, if it is
accompanied by an appropriate reason.</p>

<p>It happens sometimes that the chief of the settlement will claim a
fee for transgression upon his territory, but he will usually accept a
small present in lieu thereof, or will forego any gift, if the matter is
argued, quietly and diplomatically. The Manóbo resents harsh words,
especially when used toward him in the presence of those who are his
nominal subjects. Personalities or threats in such a case often prove
fatal.</p>

<p>It is not good etiquette to ask a Manóbo his name, especially if he
is a chief, until one has acquired somewhat of an acquaintance with him.
The information must be secured from a third party and in a quiet way.
Moreover, it is customary to address chiefs and other persons of
distinction by the names of their corresponding titles. Thus a warrior
chief is addressed <i>bagáni</i>, and not by his proper name.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that no familiarity should be taken with the
person of another until acquaintance has been cultivated far enough to
permit it. Thus touching another on the arm to call his attention to
something may be resented and may result in an attempt to collect a
fine.</p>

<p>The handling of arms requires a word. The lance must be stuck in the
ground, head up, at the foot of the house ladder; or, if it must be
brought into the house, as at night, the owner must take care that it
points at no one while being handled. If one desires to draw a bolo from
its sheath, he must draw it slowly, and if it is to be presented to
another, the blade must be kept facing the owner's body and the handle
presented to the other man. The same rule holds for the dagger.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that as a general rule the men in a Manóbo
settlement go armed and keep their hands on their weapons, especially
during mealtime, at which time it is customary to eat with the left
hand, the right hand being reserved for the use of the weapon in an
emergency.</p>

<p>There are a number of other rules of intercourse that serve to
safeguard life and to maintain proper respect on the part of each
individual for the person of his neighbor. These will be found scattered
throughout this paper.</p>

<h2>PART II. GENERAL MATERIAL CULTURE</h2>

<a name="25"></a>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<h3>THE MANÓBO HOME</h3>

<a name="251"></a>
<h4>IN GENERAL</h4>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo, as a rule builds a house of no great pretensions, because
he always remembers that an evil combination of omens or a death in the
house or an attack by his enemies, may deprive him in the near future of
his home. His best structure is better than the low wall-less
Mañgguáñgan home but can not compare with the comparatively solid
structure of the Mandáyas of Kati'il and the Debabáons of the Sálug
country.</p>

<p>He has no tribal halls, no assembly houses. In fact, with the
exception of a rude shack<sup>1</sup> on his farm, built to shelter
those who are guarding the crops against marauders (monkeys and birds),
he builds only one house, where he and usually several of his relatives
dwell until such time (usually after a year) as he finds it convenient
or necessary to abandon it.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Pin-ái-ag</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="252"></a>
<h4>MOTIVES THAT DETERMINE THE SELECTION OF THE SITE</h4>
</center>

<p>The motives that determine the selection of the site are twofold.</p>

<center>
<a name="2521"></a>
<h5>RELIGIOUS MOTIVES</h5>
</center>

<p>It is obvious that in such an important undertaking the Manóbo must
be guided by the omens and oracles that manifest to him the will of the
supernal powers. Hence, as he sallies forth to seek the site, he keeps
his ear alert for the turtledove's<sup>2</sup> prophetic cry. If this is
unfavorable, he returns home and resumes his search the following day.
It frequently happens that this omen may be unfavorable for two or three
successive days, but, however urgent the case may be, this bird's sacred
warning must on no account be disregarded, for it would mean failure,
disaster, or death, as the Manóbo can prove to you by a host of
instances that happened within his memory, or that of his relatives.
Once satisfied, however, with this first omen, he proceeds upon his
journey and selects, from material motives that will be mentioned later
on, a site for the new house, and returns to his people to inform them
of the outcome of his journey.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>Li-mo-kon</i>.</p>

<p>Now, the selection of the site is of such serious import to the
Manóbo that he must assure himself, by every means in his power, that it
is approved by the unseen powers, and for this purpose he has recourse
to the egg omen and the suspension oracle. The former I witnessed on
several occasions and in every case it proved auspicious. The
<i>bu-dá-kan</i> or vine omen is sometimes consulted in selecting a
house site, and the significance of the various configurations is the
same as that described under &#34;Divination or Omens.&#34; I was told
that this latter omen is also taken <i>in the forest</i> before the
final decision as to the selection of the site is made.</p>

<p>The occurrence of ominous dreams at this juncture, as also the
passing of a snake across the trail, are considered of evil import, but
the evil is neutralized by the fowl-waving ceremony that will be
described later.</p>

<center>
<a name="2522"></a>
<h5>MATERIAL MOTIVES</h5>
</center>

<p>When no further objection is shown by the &#34;powers above&#34; to
the selection of the home site, the Manóbo is guided by such motives as
fertility of soil, proximity of water, and fishing facilities, and, if
he is in a state of vigilance against his enemies, as in remote regions
he nearly always is, by desirability of the site for defense. In this
latter case he selects a high place difficult of access, frequently a
lofty mountain, and chooses the most strategic point upon it.</p>

<center>
<a name="253"></a>
<h4>RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES CONNECTED WITH THE ERECTION OF A HOUSE</h4>
</center>

<p>An invocation to the special deities of the family is made by a
priest, usually a relative. After an offering of a betel nut has been
made to the local deities of this particular part of the forest, the
head of the family, assisted by such of his numerous relatives as are
able to help him, proceeds to clear the ground for the new building.
When a more influential Manóbo begins to erect a capacious house,
usually everyone in the vicinity--men, women, and children--attracted by
the prospective conviviality that is sure to accompany the work, throng
to lend a helping hand, so that in a few days the clearing is made,
cleaned and planted, and the frame of the house with the roof
completed.</p>

<p>People belonging to the less influential class may take months to
complete the house, depending on the number of relatives who help them
and on the leisure that they have. It is of importance to note here that
the house must not be completed at once.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p><sup>3</sup>It is believed that the thatch must be allowed to turn
yellow before the house is completed.</p>

<p>When the first post is put into the ground, a sacrifice is frequently
made and a part of the victim's blood is poured upon the base of the
post. As soon as the roof and floor have been constructed, a formal
sacrifice of a chicken is made to the special divinities under whose
protection the family is thought to be. The chicken must be of the color
that is pleasing to these deities. An interesting feature of this
ceremony is that the center of the floor, the place intended for the
doorway, and one or more of the posts, are lustrated with the blood of
the victim.</p>

<center>
<a name="254"></a>
<h4>STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSE</h4>

<a name="2541"></a>
<h5>THE MATERIALS</h5>
</center>

<p>The materials for the house are taken from the surrounding forest and
are generally of a light character. It is only in the erection of a
house<sup>4</sup> for defense that more substantial materials are
employed.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>I-li-hán</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="2542"></a>
<h5>THE DIMENSIONS AND PLAN OF CONSTRUCTION</h5>
</center>

<p>In height from the ground to the floor the house may vary from 1.50
to 8 meters, though a structure of the latter height is infrequent. In
size it may be between 2 by 3 meters and 5 by 8 meters, but as a rule it
is nearer to the former than to the latter figures. Rectangular in form,
it is built upon light posts varying in number from 4 to 16, the 4
corner ones being larger and extending up to support the roof. Four
horizontal pieces attached to these corner posts and, supported by
several of the small posts, form, together with a few joints, the
support for the floor. In order to give more rigidity to the building
and to render the floor stronger, the joints are supported by several
posts, these last being propped by braces set at an angle of about 45°.
In the case of a house built for defense, the number of supports and
crosspieces is such that the enemy would find it impossible to hack it
down.</p>

<p>Houses built on trees were rare at the time of my stay among the
Manóbos of the Agúsan Valley. In the few cases which I saw, the tree was
cut off at a point about 2 meters above the divergence of the main
branches from the trunk. Then the house was built in the ordinary way by
erecting long auxiliary posts, the trunk of the tree and its main
branches forming the principal support. In Baglásan, upper Sálug River,
I saw a Debabáon house, belonging to Bagáni pinamailan Lantayúna, built
on a tree but without any auxiliary posts.</p>

<p>No nails, and pegs only very occasionally are employed in fastening
together the various parts of the structure. Either rattan strips or
pieces of a peculiar vine<sup>5</sup> are used in lashing the beams and
crosspieces to the posts, whereas for the other fastenings, rattan
strips are universally employed.</p>

<h5>THE FLOOR</h5>
</center>

<p>The floor consists of laths of bamboo, or of a variety of
palm<sup>6</sup> laid parallel and running along the length of the house
with more or less regular interstices. Almost universally one or both
sides of the floor, for a width of 50 centimeters to 1.5 meters, are
raised to a height varying from 10 to 50 centimeters above the main
floor. This raised portion serves for a sleeping place, but in the
poorer classes of houses the height of this platform is so slight that I
think that there exists or has existed some superstitious belief
connected with it, though I have been unable to elicit any positive
information on the point. In houses of the better class one occasionally
finds roughhewn boards used for the floor of these platforms, as also
for the walls.</p>

<h5>THE ROOF AND THE THATCH</h5>
</center>

<p>The roof is of the gable style, but is four-sided, with two smoke
vents, as may be seen in Plates 4b and 6a. The four beams that form the
main support for the rafters are lashed to the posts of the house at a
height varying from 1.5 meters to 2 meters above the floor. Four
substantial rafters, resting upon the four beams just mentioned, run up
at an angle of 45° from the corner posts. Upon these rafters rests the
ridgepole. Numerous light rafters of wood or of bamboo extend from the
ridgepole in parallel rows at intervals of 30 to 40 centimeters. They
project about 50 centimeters beyond the side beams upon which they rest
and serve to support the roofing material.</p>

<p>The thatch consists almost invariably of fronds of rattan gathered in
the adjoining forest. This thatch is made by bending back on the midrib
every alternate spike till all the spikes lie parallel. Another way is
to cut the midrib in the center at the small end and tear the frond into
two pieces. These half-fronds are neither so durable nor so serviceable
as if the midrib is left entire. Two, three, or four of these fronds, or
double that number of half-fronds, are then superimposed, and fastened
to the rafters with rattan in shingle fashion.</p>

<p>In localities where sago palm is available an excellent thatch is
made in the ordinary Philippine fashion by sewing the spikes of the
frond to a slat of bamboo. It is claimed that this thatch will not last
much more than a year, as it is a breeding place for a multitude of
small cockroaches that seem to thrive upon it.</p>

<p>In the mountainous districts, where up to a few years ago feuds were
rife, it was not uncommon to find houses roofed with big strips of bark,
or with shingles of flattened bamboo. This style of roofing was employed
as a precaution against the burning arrows used by the enemy during an
attack.</p>

<p>There is always an extra layer of leaves over the ridgepole as a
protection against the rain. Occasionally a long strip or two of bark is
placed as a hood on the ridgepole to help prevent the entrance of the
rain during the northwest monsoon, when it comes down in indescribable
torrents.</p>

<p>A glance at the illustrations will show better than words can
describe the peculiar smoke outlets invariably found in Manóbo houses.
They not only afford an exit for the smoke, and admit light, but also
permit, during storms, the entrance of an amount of rain that does not
conduce to comfort.</p>

<center>
<a name="2545"></a>
<h5>THE WALLS</h5>
</center>

<p>The walls are nearly always in the case of better class houses, light
poles of wood or of bamboo, laid horizontally one above the other and
tied to upright pieces placed at intervals for their support. In poorer
houses palm fronds are tied loosely to a few upright pieces. The eaves
project down almost as far as the top of the walls. The latter never
extend to the roof, but are usually of such a height that a person
sitting on the floor can see between the walls and the eaves the space
surrounding the house. It is rare to find boards used for the walls,
but, if used, they are roughhewn, and are laid horizontally and
edgewise, one above the other. They are held in place with rattan
strips.</p>

<p>The space, then, between the top of the walls and the roof is open
all around the house and serves as one continuous window that affords
more ventilation than light. The purpose of this peculiar arrangement
seems to be for defense, for no one can approach the house from any side
without being seen, and, in time of attack, it affords the inmates of
the house an admirable vantage ground from which to ply their arrows.</p>

<center>
<a name="2546"></a>
<h5>THE DOORWAY AND THE LADDER</h5>
</center>

<p>There is no door in a Manóbo house. In the middle of one end of the
house a small opening is left scarcely wide enough for two persons to
enter at one time. A notched pole leads up to this opening. If the house
is high, a certain amount of maneuvering on the part of one not
accustomed to it, may be required in climbing the pole, for there is
seldon[sic] any rail to aid one and the notches are not of the deepest.
This is another of the Manóbo's devices against enemies, for on
occasions of attack the inmates of a house can dislodge by a slight
movement of this cylindrical ladder any foolhardy enemy who might
attempt, under protection of his shield, to make an ascent during a
fight.</p>

<p>In the house of a chief or well-to-do Manóbo, one frequently finds a
crude ladder for the convenience of the family dogs.</p>

<center>
<a name="2547"></a>
<h5>INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS</h5>
</center>

<p>The internal arrangements of the house are very simple. The one
ceilingless square area between the roof and the floor constitutes the
house. There is no dining room, no kitchen, no bedroom, no toilet. Even
the little stalls erected by Mandáyas for the married couples are very
seldom to be found. The owner of the house occupies the part farthest
from the door, and nearest the fire, while visitors are relegated to the
part near the door.</p>

<center>
<a name="2548"></a>
<h5>DECORATIONS</h5>
</center>

<p>No paint is applied to the house and, with the exception of a rude
carving of the ridgepole into the suggestion of a human head with a
rudimentary body, there is no decoration in the interior. On the
outside, one frequently sees at the ends of the ridgepole, and set
upright at right angles to each other, two narrow, thin pieces of wood
about 1 meter long. Along the sides of these are cuttings which are
intended to represent the crested head of a fowl, as the name given to
them indicates.<sup>7</sup></p>

<a name="255"></a>
<h4>THE FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT OF THE HOUSE</h4>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo house fittings are of the scantiest and most necessary
kind. The tenure of the house may be brief, depending, as it does, upon
a suspicion of danger or even on a dream. So the Manóbo does not indulge
in the luxury of chairs, tables, or similar articles. The upraised
portion of the floor, or the floor itself, serves him as a chair and a
bench. For a table he uses a small board such as is so universally used
throughout Mindanáo by the poorer classes. Yet many are the houses that
can not boast of even this simple equipment. He has no bedsteads, for
the bamboo floor with a grass mat thrown over it affords him a cool and
comfortable resting place. He has a fair abundance of mats, but they are
ordinarily short, being made according to the length of the grass he
happens to find. By day these mats are rolled up and laid aside on the
floor or upon the beams of the house. If left on the floor, they afford
the family dogs, who ensconce themselves therein, a convenient refuge
from flies.</p>

<p>He dispenses with the use of pillows, unless the handiest piece of
wood or of bamboo can be called a pillow. Lacking that, he lays his head
upon the mat and enjoys as good a sleep, perhaps, as his more civilized
fellowmen.</p>

<p>It is seldom, indeed, that he uses a mosquito bar, though wild
<i>abaká</i> is abundant and his wife is a weaver. The mosquito bars
which are in use are made out of <i>abaká</i> fiber. As the cloth for
them, made on the ordinary loom, is less than a meter wide, and as much
as 24 meters long, it must be cut up into strips nearly 2 meters long
and sewn together to form the mosquito bar. It must be made of an odd
number of pieces of cloth, for an even number is unlucky. A net made of
11 or 13 pieces is considered especially lucky. The use of the mosquito
bar is very common among the <i>conquistas</i> of the Lake region.</p>

<p>Pictures and like ornaments are unknown, but in lieu of them may be
seen trophies of the chase, such as wild-boar jawbones, deer antlers,
and hornbill skulls and beaks. It is not infrequent to see the tail of
some large fish fastened to one of the larger beams, under the roof.
There is a special significance in the preservation of this trophy.</p>

<p>There is one article, however, which the Manóbo prizes as a mark of
wealth and as a venerable relic. It is the sacred jar.<sup>8</sup> I
have been unable to obtain any information as to the origin of these
jars except that they were usually obtained as marriage fees and that
they were bought from the Banuáons. Be that as it may, they are a matter
of pride in Manóboland, and on every occasion, festive and religious,
they are set out, brimful of brew. Not every Manóbo is the proud
possessor of one of these, but he who has one is loath to part with it.
A glance at Plate 14 <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, will give an idea of what these
jars look like. They are decorated, as a rule, in alto relievo with
figures of birds, snakes, etc., and to judge from their appearance are
of Chinese workmanship. When given as marriage payments or for other
purposes they are valued at about 4 pesos if they have no ears, but when
they have ears they are worth as many pesos minus 1 as they have
ears.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Ba-hán-di</i>.</p>

<p>Next to jars the Manóbo values plates and bowls, even those of the
cheapest kind, and it is with a gleam of satisfaction on his face that
the host sets out an array of old-fashioned plates for his guests. The
Manóbo of the middle Agúsan, unlike his Mandáya neighbor, is
particularly poor in plateware. I found houses that could not boast of a
single plate, but as a rule each house has about four plates, a bowl,
and a glass.</p>

<p>Depending from the roof are to be seen baskets of various shapes
intended for a variety of uses, fish baskets, rice baskets of several
kinds, storage baskets, betel-nut baskets, pack baskets, some of
wickerwork and some of plaited rattan. Also, hanging from the rafters
are to be seen fish traps, wild chicken traps, religious objects such as
oblation trays, a guitar, or a bamboo harp, and if it is a priest's
house, a drum and gong.</p>

<p>One sees almost invariably a nest or two up in a corner under the
roof. They are for the domestic hens and are ungainly things, made
ordinarily out of a piece of old matting. In these the hens lay their
eggs, after meandering around the rafters and disturbing the inmates of
the house with their cackling. After the eggs are laid, it is frequently
necessary to drive the hens from the house.</p>

<p>The fireplace is another very important item in the house. It is
usually located on the side of the house away from the door and near the
wall. It consists of four roughhewn pieces of wood approximately 1 meter
long and about 10 centimeters high, set together on the floor and lashed
in the form of a rectangle. A piece of bark is placed on the floor
within this rectangle, and the inclosed space is filled with earth. A
half dozen stones form supports for the earthen jars. Above the
fireplace is a rough frame for firewood, of which there is usually a
plentiful supply. Here the wood is dried thoroughly before it is
used.</p>

<p>In close proximity to the hearth and scattered around without any
regard for tidiness may be seen the rice winnow, the bamboo water tube,
the coconut-shell watercup, the rice paddles and ladles, leaves of
banana and other plants, and the whetstone, while on the fireplace are
seen a variety of earthen pots with their covers, and frequently an
imported iron pan for cooking.</p>

<p>Tied up under the roof, but within reach, may be seen bows and
arrows, probably a fish spear, or it may be, a fish rod. Spears and
other weapons of defense which, when not in use, are unsheathed and put
into a rude wooden rack made for the purpose, while the sheaths are hung
up close by.</p>

<p>It is not exceptional to find a cage with a turtledove<sup>9</sup> or
a variety of parrakeet[sic]<sup>10</sup> in it. The cage is usually hung
from the roof under the eaves outside the wall. The turtledove is kept
for religious purposes, whereas the parrakeet[sic] is kept as other
people keep a pet bird, though it is occasionally employed by the young
folks as a lure to attract its wild fellows to the bird line.</p>

Tweedale). Generally called fruit dove.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup><i>ku-li-li-si</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="256"></a>
<h4>THE UNDERPART AND THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE HOUSE</h4>
</center>

<p>The space under the fireplace is usually not occupied because of the
water and refuse that fall from the kitchen, but to one side of it is
the inevitable pigpen, containing a pig or two. It is only the wealthier
Manóbos who can boast of more than a few, for the maintenance of many
would be a heavy drain on their limited food supply. These few pigs
subsist on such scraps and parings as may be thrown or allowed to fall
down to them.</p>

<p>To one side of the pigpen, if there is room, is placed the rice
mortar, an article of indispensable necessity in every household. In it
is hulled with wooden pestles, and frequently in measured time, the
daily supply of rice.</p>

<p>At the time when the house is constructed, the forest adjoining is
cleared, and <i>camotes</i>,<sup>11</sup> a little sugarcane, and a few
other things are planted. The house usually overlooks this clearing at
least on one side. On the other sides there is usually the grim, silent
forest. When the house is built with a view to defense, trees are felled
all around in such a way as to make a regular abatis. Ordinarily there
are at least two trails, one, a main trail, so tortuous and difficult,
in the generality of cases, that it would lead one to imagine that the
owner of the house had deliberately selected it for its difficulties,
the other, a trail leading to the watering place. In approaching the
house the visitor is obliged to climb over fallen logs, the passing of
which requires no little maneuvering on the part of a novice. Without a
guide it would be often difficult, if not impossible, to locate the
houses, even if one had been shown their location from a distance.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup><i>Ipomoea batatas</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="257"></a>
<h4>ORDER AND CLEANLINESS OF THE HOUSE</h4>
</center>

<p>As from one to four families may live in a single house, it is
needless to say that there is generally a decided appearance of
disorder, as well as a tumult that baffles description. In the only room
of the house are congregated the married couples, generally a few extra
relatives, their children, and their dogs. The Manóbos are naturally
very loud talkers, their children, especially the infants, are as noisy
as children the world over, and their dogs, which may number from 3 to
15, are so constituted that, when they are not fighting with one
another, they may at any moment, without apparent motive or provocation,
begin one grand dismal howl which, united to the crying of the babies
and to the loud tones of their elders, produces a pandemonium. It is at
meal times that the pandemonium waxes loudest, for at that time the
half-starved dogs, in their efforts to get a morsel to eat, provoke the
inmates to loud yells of &#34;Sida, sida,&#34;<sup>12</sup> and to other
more forcible actions.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>An exclamation to drive away a dog.</p>

<p>In a large house, with such a conglomeration of human beings, it is
obvious that an impression of confusion is made upon the visitor. The
performance of the various culinary operations by the women, the various
employments in which the men are engaged, making arrows, fish traps,
etc., the romping of the children, all these tend to heighten the
impression. But the Manóbo goes on with his work, tranquil in the midst
of it all, savoring his conversation with incessant quids of betel nut
or tobacco.</p>

<p>The Manóbo has not yet come to a knowledge of the various microbes
and parasites that are liable to undermine the foundations of health, so
that the sanitary condition of his house is not such as would pass a
modern inspection. Both men and women are inveterate chewers of betel
nut and tobacco, and, instead of using a spittoon, they expectorate the
saliva through the interstices of the floor or anywhere that they may
find convenient, thereby tinging the floor and walls a bright red. As
the Manóbo broom is a most crude affair made out of a few twigs, it does
not remove all the remains of the meals as they lie spread over the
floor. The peelings of sugarcane, the skin of bananas and of other
fruits, the remains of rattan, and such other refuse as may be the
result of the various occupations that take place in the house are all
strewn around the floor and frequently are not removed for a
considerable length of time.</p>

<p>In the preparation and cooking of food a considerable amount of water
fails necessairly[sic] under the house which, together with the excreta
of the inmates and the other refuse, animal and vegetable, produces a
somewhat unfavorable appearance and sometimes an unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>There is no drainage, artificial or natural and no means are provided
for the removal of the ordure, unless it be the services of the
scavenger pigs, who busy themselves as soon as they become aware of the
presence of refuse. The effluvium, however, usually does not reach the
inmates unless the house is very low.</p>

<p>As the smoke outlets are comparatively remote from the fireplace, it
is obvious that the smoke does not make a rapid exit, but wreathes up
among the beams and rafters thereby blackening them out of all semblance
to wood. The underside of the thatch, especially those portions above
the fire, receives a goodly coating of soot which, mixed with the greasy
emanations from the pots, assumes a lustrous black.</p>

<p>Another matter that tends to give the house an air and feeling of
uncleanliness is the host of small insects, presumably a species of
cockroach, that infest the thatch, and, notwithstanding the volume of
smoke that at times almost suffocates the inmates, swarm down into the
baskets used for provisions and for other things. These multitudinous
insects seem to flourish on the rattan vine especially, and no means are
known whereby to exterminate them. Ants, especially the white ant, pay
frequent visits to the house, but the worst scourge of all is the
ravenous bedbug. This unpleasant insect is found under the joists just
beneath the floor laths, but in greatest numbers under those parts of
the floor that are continually used as sleeping places, and in the
hammocks. Occasionally an effort is made to scrape them out, but they
are so cunning in concealing themselves and breed with such rapidity
that efforts to get rid of them are unavailing.</p>

<p>The presence of vermin on the bodies of the Manóbos is due to the
lack of soap and of washing facilities. But, if questioned, these
primitive people will inform you, that the vermin are natural growths or
excretions proceeding from the inside.<sup>13</sup> It is for this
reason that no shame is exhibited in removing publicly the pests from
the clothes or from the hair. Owing to the custom of the people of
huddling together during the night these insects are propagated from one
individual to another, so that it is seldom that the Manóbo is free from
them.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>I found this belief to be almost universal in eastern
Mindanáo.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<h3>DRESS</h3>

<a name="261"></a>
<h4>GENERAL REMARKS.</h4>

<a name="2611"></a>
<h5>DELICACY IN EXPOSURE OF THE PERSON</h5>
</center>

<p>Like all tribes of eastern Mindanáo, Manóbos, both men and women,
wear sufficient clothes to cover the private parts of the body. Children
up to the age of 5 or 6 years may go without clothes, but female
children commonly wear a triangular pubic shield<sup>1</sup> of coconut
shell, suspended by a waist string. Men, though they may denude
themselves completely when bathing, always conceal their pudenda from
one another's gaze.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Pú-ki</i>.</p>

<p>Married and elderly women may occasionally expose the upper part of
their persons, but unmarried girls seldom do so. No delicacy is felt in
exposing the breasts during the suckling of a babe.</p>

<center>
<a name="2612"></a>
<h5>VARIETY IN QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF CLOTHES</h5>
</center>

<p>The quantity and quality of clothes worn varies slightly in different
localities. The farther away from settlements the people live, the
poorer and less elaborate is the dress, due to their inability to obtain
the imported cloth and cotton yarn, for which they entertain a high
preference. On the upper Agúsan, where the Manóbos have adopted a
certain amount of Mandáya culture, their apparel partakes of the more
gorgeous character of that of the Mandáya. In places where they are of
Mañgguáñgan descent, as is often the case on the upper Agúsan, on the
Mánat, on the upper Ihawán and tributaries, and on the upper Sálug,
their clothes resemble those of their poor progenitors. In the middle
Agúsan (including the Wá-wa, Kasilaían, lower Argáwan, lower Umaíam,
lower Ihawán, Híbung, and Simúlau Rivers) the dress may be called
characteristically Manóbo.</p>

<center>
<a name="2613"></a>
<h5>THE USE OF BARK CLOTH</h5>
</center>

<p>The use of bark cloth<sup>2</sup> in a region situated somewhere
between the headwaters of the Libagánon and the Sábud, a western
tributary of the Ihawán, was reported to me. My informants, both on the
Sálug River and on the Umaíam River, spoke of the people of that
locality as <i>true Manóbos</i>, very dark in color, and wearing bark
clothes. If this report is correct, and I am inclined to give credence
to it, it is probably the only case at the present time of the use of
bark cloth in Mindanáo, excepting perhaps among the Manánuas[sic].</p>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>A-ga-hán</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="2614"></a>
<h5>DRESS AS AN INDICATION OF RANK</h5>
</center>

<p>There are no characteristic dresses by which the rank or profession
of the wearer is indicated except that of the warrior chief. Female
priests very frequently may be distinguished by a prodigality of charms,
talismans, and girdle pendants, as also by a profuseness of embroidery
on the jacket, but such lavishness is not necessarily an infallible sign
of their rank as priestesses but rather of their wealth. Neither is it a
mark of their unmarried condition, for in Manóboland, as in other parts
of the world, the maiden loves to display her person to good advantage
and for that reason decks herself with all the finery of which she may
be the possessor.</p>

<p>Slaves may be recognized by the wretchedness of their clothes.</p>

<center>
<a name="2615"></a>
<h5>DRESS IN GENERAL</h5>
</center>

<p>The man's dress invariably consists of long loose trousers or of
close-fitting breeches, and of a moderately tight-fitting, buttonless
jacket. These two articles of dress are supplemented by a bamboo hat, a
betel-nut knapsack, and by such adornments in the shape of beads, and
other things, as the man may have been able to acquire.</p>

<p>The woman's dress consists almost invariably of a close-fitting,
buttonless jacket with red body and black sleeves. Her skirt is a double
sacklike garment made out of <i>abaká</i> fiber. A girdle of braided
human hair or of braided vegetable fiber holds this coarse dress in
place. A selection of beads, shells, and herbs hang from this girdle at
the right side. A comb in the hair, a pair of ear disks in the ears, a
few necklets, and frequently leglets, complete the apparel. The
children's clothing is a duplicate of that of their respective parents
on a smaller and less elaborate scale.</p>

<center>
<a name="2616"></a>
<h5>PREFERENTIAL COLORS IN DRESS</h5>
</center>

<p>In the matter of color a decided preference is shown for red, yellow,
white, and dark blue. This is not so exacting in the case of beads,
which are purchased indiscriminately, but even in these I am of the
opinion that if there were a choice in the supply, the above-mentioned
colors would be preferred.</p>

<p>The Manóbo, then, is not encumbered with all the weight and variety
of modern modes and fashions. Shoes, slippers, and hose are not a part
of his apparel. Blankets and other articles for protection against cold
are not to be found in his wardrobe. In the house and out of the house,
by night and by day, in peace and in war, his dress is the same, one
suit for every day usage and one for festal occasions and for visits.</p>

<center>
<a name="262"></a>
<h4>THE MAN'S DRESS</h4>

<a name="2621"></a>
<h5>HATS AND HEADKERCHIEFS</h5>
</center>

<p>The hat worn on the Ihawán, upper Agúsan, and upper Simúlau resembles
that worn by Mandáyas. It is made out of two pieces of
bamboo,<sup>3</sup> dried over the fire into the desired shape, and is
held together by two slender strips of rattan running around and
stitched to the edges of the headpiece proper. These pieces project
backward and overlap to form the tail of the hat. The upper surface of
the whole hat is then painted with beeswax. The sustaining pieces of
rattan around the rim and the under surface of the back part receive a
heavy coating of this same material mixed with pot black. Odd tracings
and dottings of beeswax and soot or of the juice of a certain
tree<sup>4</sup> serve to decorate the whole upper surface; small seed
beads, usually white, are often sewed around the rim in a single row and
at slight intervals, or are sewed on the top, especially around the
conical peak. Little tufts of cotton are sometimes dotted over the top,
and occasionally one finds the emerald green wings of a
beetle<sup>5</sup> placed in the seams on top. All of these devices
serve to enhance the beauty of the headpiece.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Caña bojo</i>.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>Ka-yú-ti</i>.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>Called <i>dú-yau</i>.</p>

<p>A notable feature of the hat is five or six tail plumes of a domestic
rooster. These are set upright in small holes in the back part of the
hat and are held in place by lumps of beeswax placed at the ends of the
quills, which protrude through the bamboo. It is needless to say that
the most gaudy plumes are selected for this purpose. They enhance in no
small degree the elegant appearance of the hat. These plumes curve very
gracefully indeed, and nod in unison with every movement of the
wearer.</p>

<p>The hat is held on the head by two strings made either of braided
imported cotton of the typical colors, of <i>abaká</i> fiber of the same
colors, of vegetable fiber, or of slender slips of rattan. These two
strings, often strung with beads, are attached at both ends of the hat
and are sufficiently loose to permit the head of the wearer to be
inserted between them. A further adornment may consist of two or more
beaded pendants that may be tipped with tassels of imported cotton of
the preferential colors.</p>

<p>The hat, on the whole, is serviceable, economical, and cool, and
serves to set off its wearer to good advantage and to protect his hair
from the rain. As far as I have been able to ascertain, the decorative
tracings and appanages on the hat have no other significance than that
of personal adornment.</p>

<p>A second form of head covering, in use in the parts of the Agúsan
River Valley not mentioned above, as also among the Manóbos of the
Pacific coast,<sup>6</sup> is circular. It is made of the sago palm or
of bamboo. It varies in diameter between 25 and 35 centimeters and has
the shape of a low broad cone. The edges, like those of the hat already
described, are reinforced with rattan painted with a mixture of beeswax
and pot black for preserving the rattan against atmospheric influences.
No paint is applied to the sago sheath, but the beeswax is applied to
the bamboo as a preservative against cracking. Neither are any
decorative incisions or tracings used in this form of hat, it being
primarily and essentially for protection against sun and rain. Two
parallel strips of rattan fastened at the ends of a diagonal serve to
hold the hat in position on the head.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>The Manóbos of the Pacific coast inhabit the upper waters
of the Kantílan, Tándag, Tágo, Marihátag, Húbo, Bislig, and Liñgig
Rivers.</p>

<p>A noteworthy feature of this hat is that within the area mentioned
above, it is frequently worn by women. I know of no other headdress that
is employed by the female members of the Manóbo, Mandáya, and Debabáon
tribes.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p><sup>7</sup>The Manóbos of the lower Agúsan, inhabiting the towns of
San Vicente, Amparo, San Mateo, Las Nieves, and surrounding regions are
not referred to here. The Debabáons are looked upon as forming a
separate tribe till further investigation.</p>

<p>Besides the headkerchief,<sup>8</sup> worn universally by warrior
chiefs<sup>9</sup> and recognized warriors<sup>10</sup> throughout all
tribes in eastern Mindanáo, a kerchief<sup>11</sup> bound round the head
is very often worn by Manóbos of the Argáwan and Umaíam Rivers.</p>

<h5>THE JACKET</h5>
</center>

<p>In general the jacket is close-fitting, square-cut, and closed. It
has long sleeves and a tongue-shaped opening for the head extending from
the neck downward in front. Ordinarily the jacket is scarcely long
enough to reach the top of the trousers. It is not rare to find a narrow
strip of cloth of a color different from the rest of the jacket inserted
between the sleeves and body of the garment or running down the waist
between the two pieces that form the body. This sidepiece in the jacket
of men and women serves to give the desired width to the garment and the
variation in color secured by it is regarded as an addition to the
general ornamental effect. The jacket is embroidered more or less
elaborately according to the skill of the embroiderer and the amount of
imported cotton yarn available. This embroidery is done on the back from
shoulder to shoulder in a band from 4 to 6 centimeters broad, and in
continuous narrow lines around the neck opening, along the seams between
the sleeves and body of the garment, on the lower parts of the sleeves,
around the waist at the bottom of the garment, and down the arm at the
joining of the sleeves; in a word, over all seams.</p>

<p>In the central portion of the Agúsan Valley and on the Pacific coast,
the most common form of jacket is made of unstained <i>abaká</i> fiber
cut like the one just described. It has, however, inwoven in the cloth,
horizontal parallel lines of dark-blue yarn on the back and the upper
part of the front. These dark-blue bands are set at intervals from each
other and usually amount to from six to nine lines in number. Tufts of
cotton in a continuous recurrence of red, yellow, and dark blue, without
any interstices, cover all the seams. If there is any embroidery, it is
upon the lower part of the sleeves, on that part of the jacket that
covers the back of the neck, and along the seams between the sleeves and
the body of the jacket. The distribution of this style of garment is
very wide. I have seen it on the Tágo River (Pacific coast), on the
upper Umaíam, Argáwan, Kasilaían, and Simúlau Rivers.</p>

<p>On the upper Agúsan, including the upper Bahaí-an, Ihawán, and Baóbo
Rivers, a style that resembles the Mandáya is most frequently to be
seen. The jacket is made of a gauze-like <i>abaká</i> cloth dyed black,
or preferably of black or blue imported cloth. One frequently finds, for
ornamental purposes, just above the wrists or between the sleeves and
the body of the jacket, or down the waist between the main pieces of the
garment, thin strips of white cloth inserted. Usually there is no
embroidery as such, the previously described alternating tufts of cotton
yarn covering all, or nearly all, the seams. When, however, it is
desired and it is feasible to adorn the garment with embroidery, the
back-of the jacket from shoulder to shoulder, the space along the
shoulder seams and the back and front of the sleeves are selected for
this prupose[sic]. Bands 5 to 7 centimeters in breadth of more or less
intricate pattern are embroidered in these places, with much patient
labor and no little skill. It is needless to say that the ordinary
colors, with a predominance of red, are used.</p>

<center>
<a name="2623"></a>
<h5>THE LOWER GARMENT</h5>
</center>

<p>The lower garment is of two kinds, one being a short, close-fitting
garment made out of either undyed <i>abaká</i> fiber with a woof of
native cotton or of imported blue cloth. This garment resembles closely
the ordinary bathing tights. It is the working breeches of the Manóbo
and makes no pretense of being ornamental. The white or undyed form is
the more common.</p>

<p>The other kind of lower garment worn by the men may be called
trousers, though they reach only about halfway between the knees and the
ankles. They are square-legged and baggy, made of undyed <i>abaká</i>
fiber or of <i>abaká</i> fiber with a woof of cotton, both undyed.
Whenever it is obtainable, imported blue cloth is used. The two legs of
the trousers are each about 65 centimeters long by 24 centimeters broad
and are joined together by a triangular piece of cloth. These trousers
are worn on festive and other occasions that require a display of
personal dignity.</p>

<p>The decoration of the trousers consists usually of fringes of
imported cotton attached to all the seams except those around the waist.
When it is considered desirable to make a more showy garment, embroidery
of cotton yarn is added to the ends of the legs and to the part that
covers the sides of the calves. The designs used depend on whether the
wearer is of the central or of the upper Agúsan group.</p>

<center>
<a name="2624"></a>
<h5>THE GIRDLE</h5>
</center>

<p>Around the waist of the garment is a hem through which passes a
drawstring or girdle usually of braided <i>abaká</i> fiber dyed in the
usual colors, with dependent extremities and tassels of imported cotton,
also in the preferential colors. On the upper Agúsan one finds at times
beads and even small bells added to the tassels. These are allowed to
hang down in front.</p>

<p>The method of fastening the girdle is by the ordinary method of
tieing[sic], or by another simple method, which consists in attaching
near one end of the drawstring the operculum of a shell said to be found
in the forests. At the other end of the girdle is a loop large enough to
admit the operculum, which on being slipped into this loop retains the
garment in position.</p>

<center>
<a name="2625"></a>
<h5>THE BETEL-NUT KNAPSACK<sup>12</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Pú-yó</i>.</p>

<p>The knapsack is such an omnipresent, indispensable object that it may
be considered a part of Manóbo raiment. It is a rectangular bag, on an
average approximately 30 by 25 centimeters, with a drawstring for
closing it. This string is nearly always of multicolored braided
<i>abaká</i> fiber, and is a continuation of the strings by which the
knapsack is suspended on the back from the shoulders, so that when it is
carried in that position the mouth of it is always closed. The cloth of
which it is made is the usual undyed <i>abaká</i> cloth, though among
the upper Agúsan group one finds in use blue imported cloth or, perhaps
more frequently, Mandáya cloth,<sup>13</sup> imported especially for
knapsacks.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>Called <i>gú-au</i>.</p>

<p>The decoration consists of embroidery, more or less extensive, of the
type that is characteristic of the wearer's group and which corresponds
to that of his dress, if the dress is decorated. Tassels of imported
cotton at the extremities of the drawstrings, and perhaps pendants of
small seeds, or beads, usually white, together with cotton fringes in
proper colors, enhance the beauty of the knapsack. As a rule, however,
among the Manóbos of regions remote from Christian settlements, one
finds little attempt at decoration, either of the dress or of the
knapsack. A few fringes of cotton yarn and a little ornamental
stitchwork are about the only display attempted. This lack of decoration
is due not only to the fact that they have little cotton yarn, but also
to lack of ability on the part of the women. The latter fact might lead
the observer to conclude that the art of embroidery and cloth decoration
originated outside the tribe.</p>

<center>
<a name="263"></a>
<h4>THE WOMAN'S DRESS</h4>

<a name="2631"></a>
<h5>THE JACKET</h5>
</center>

<p>The great distinguishing mark of a woman's dress is the difference in
color between the body of the upper garment, which is almost invariably
red, and the sleeves, which must always be of a different color. Should
the body be made of black cloth, then the sleeves are always of red. And
if the sleeves are of black, blue, or white, then the body must be of
red.</p>

<p>Another differentiating feature of the woman's jacket is that the
cuffs, if they may be so called, are generally of the color of the body
of the garment, and that the pieces often inserted between the main
parts of the body and extending vertically down the sides from the
armpits are of the same color, and, if possible, of the same material as
the upper parts of the sleeves. These two points, together with the more
extensive and elaborate embroidery, serve to distinguish the woman's
upper garment from the man's.</p>

<p>In the regions which I visited the styles of jackets may be reduced
to two, the more elaborate types of which are as follows:</p>

<a name="26311"></a>
<p><i>The upper Agúsan style</i>.--On the upper Agúsan, on the Ihawán
(excepting on its western tributaries), and on the Bahaían, the woman's
jacket partakes of the style and characteristics of that of the Mandáya.
In shape it is not different from that of the man, but is more
close-fitting, especially the sleeves, which may be compared to a long
cylinder. Lines of cotton yarn in alternating colors cover and adorn the
seams and the oval-shaped opening for the neck, but are not found on the
bottom of the jacket. Embroidery of skillful and intricate design, in
bands about 5 or 6 centimeters wide, adorns the garment on the back from
shoulder to shoulder and around the seam at which the sleeves are joined
to the body of the jacket.</p>

<p>This garment is made out of either gauzelike <i>abaká</i> cloth of
native weaving, dyed either red or black, or it is of imported European
cloth obtained by barter. Sometimes it is a combination of the two, when
enough imported cloth has not been obtained.</p>

<a name="26312"></a>
<p><i>The style of the central group</i>.--The main differences between
this style and that just described are that the latter is more loosely
cut in the body and sleeves, is more profusely embroidered, and has a
longitudinal cut in the cuffs for the admission of the hands. One finds,
too, but only very occasionally, a type of jacket in which the sleeves
are white and the body black.</p>

<p>The embroidery may be so profuse that it covers not only the lower
halves of the sleeves and the back of the neck, but the whole front of
the garment.</p>

<center>
<a name="2632"></a>
<h5>THE GIRDLE AND ITS PENDANTS</h5>
</center>

<p>The girdle may be a mere braided cord of <i>abaká</i> fiber often
mixed with strands of cotton yarn, but more commonly it is a series of
braided cords of <i>nito</i>,<sup>14</sup> or of human hair. The girdle
is made by braiding the <i>nito</i> or the hair into circular cords,
each about 45 centimeters in length and about 2 millimeters in width.
Anywhere from 10 to 20 of these braids are fastened together by
involving the ends in small pieces of cloth wrapped with cotton yarn of
the preferential colors.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup><i>Lygodium circinnatum</i> sp.</p>

<p>To one end of this girdle is attached a numerous array of beads,
shells, and charms. To the other is attached a braided <i>abaká</i>
cord, also variegated with the proper colors, which enables the wearer
to fasten and tighten the girdle. One frequently sees white seed beads
in greater or less quantity strung on each cord of this form of belt.</p>

<p>The pendants are a very noticeable feature of the girdle. Hung from
the right side they present to the eye anything but a pleasing effect.
Bundles of white scented grass, about 5 centimeters long by 1 centimeter
in diameter, that have dried to a semblance of hay, detract most from
the appearance of the wearer. The whole mass of pendants is a tangle of
divers objects, the quantity of which depends upon the good fortune of
the wearer. The following are the objects that may be found among these
pendants: Large hawk bells, seldom exceeding six in number and
ordinarily not more than three; bunches of odorous grass, amounting
sometimes to as much as eight in number; the red seed of the
<i>ma-gu-hai</i> tree; small shells, especially cowry shells, picked up,
it is said, in the forest; the pods of the <i>ta-bí-gi</i> tree, one or
more, used for carrying incense<sup>15</sup> for religious purposes;
odoriferous seeds and roots<sup>16</sup> cut up small and strung on
<i>abaká</i> filaments with such beads as the wearer may not desire to
use, because of their color or shape, for the ornamentation of other
parts of his body.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>Called <i>pa-lí-na</i>. It is obtained by tapping the
<i>ma-gu-baí</i> tree.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>The following are the native names of the roots and
plants seen by the writer: <i>ta-bó</i>, the seed of a plant which looks
like a sweet potato; <i>sá-i</i>, a helmet-shaped seed of a tree of the
same name; <i>kú-su</i>, the root of a leguminous plant;
<i>ma-gu-baí</i>, the bright red seed of a tree of the same name. It is
interesting to note that this same seed is used for the eyes of sacred
images. <i>Ka-bis-da'</i> and <i>ko-múd-la</i> are also made use of.</p>

<p>The purpose of these various objects is, to all appearances, to
ornament the person and to impart a fragrance to the wearer. In this
last respect the redolent herbs and seeds admirably fulfill their
purpose. But many of these objects serve other ends, medicinal and
religious. I took no little pains in investigating this point, but the
replies to my inquiries were at times so indeterminate, at others so
varied, and so contradictory that I can not make any definite statement;
but I am strongly inclined to believe, for sundry reasons, that both
medicinal and magic powers are attributed to many of the
innocent-looking objects that go to make up the girdle pendants.</p>

<center>
<a name="2633"></a>
<h5>THE SKIRT</h5>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo woman is not encumbered with all the wearing apparel of
more cultured tribes. She vests herself with the simple sacklike skirt
of good strong <i>abaká</i> cloth, durable, and admirably suited to her
manner of life.</p>

<p>As the cloth comes from the loom it is in one long rectangular piece
(3.6 meters by 90 centimeters more or less). It is cut in two and the
ends of each of the two pieces are sewed together, so that two
bottomless sacks are made. These two sacks are then joined together,
thus forming one long rectangular garment, which by night serves for
blanket, sheet, and frequently mosquito bar, and by day for a skirt.
When used as a skirt, it is folded over in such a way that it resembles
two sacks, one inside the other. As it is considerably larger than the
person of the wearer it must be drawn to one side, always the left, and
tucked in. The lower part of the garment on the left side bulges out so
far that it makes the woman's figure ungraceful in appearance.</p>

<p>From the dimensions given above it follows that the dress does not
reach much below the knees, a salutary arrangement, indeed, for one
whose occupations lead her through the slush of forest trails and the
grime of farming life.</p>

<p>There are two types of skirt in common use; first, the type that is
of purely Manóbo manufacture, and, second, the type that is imported
from the Mandáyas of southeastern Mindanáo.</p>

<p>The purely Manóbo type is distinguished by its simplicity and absence
of elaborate design. Alternating bands of red and black, with dividing
lines of white, all running longitudinally along the warp, and inwoven,
are the only effort at beauty of design.</p>

<p>The second form of skirt is that imported from the Mandáyas or
purchased, whenever obtainable, from Bisáya traders or, on the upper
Agúsan, from trafficking intermediaries. It is striking with what
appreciation the Manóbo regards this article. A Manóbo from the Argáwan
and Umaíam will travel over to Hinatuán, a journey of three or four
days, to procure a piece of Mandáya skirt cloth. He values it above the
costliest pieces of European fabric that he has seen. The Manóbo woman
upon seeing a fine specimen dances with joy, and is long and loud in her
praise of it. No value is too high for such a specimen and no sacrifice
too great to purchase it.</p>

<p>The explanation of this high regard in which Mandáya cloth is held is
simple. The cloth is made, I was habitually assured by Manóbos, <i>by
enchantment</i>, under the direction of the priestesses in the lofty
mountain fastnesses of Mandáyaland.<sup>17</sup> No other explanation
will satisfy the credulous Manóbo. He can not possibly understand how
the fanciful and elegant designs on Mandáya cloth can be produced by
other than supernatural means.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>I have covered nearly the whole of the Mandáya country
and can testify to the numerous religious practices and restrictions
connected with the fabrication of the cloth.</p>

<p>The cloth as it comes from the loom is of practically the same size
as Manóbo cloth and it is made into the form of a skirt in identically
the same way. The only difference is that the Mandáya fabric is heavier
and has a beautiful inwoven pattern.</p>

<p>A minute description of the patterns would be needlessly lengthy and
necessarily deficient. In general, it may be said that the designs are
executed in longitudinal panels, of which there are several lateral and
one central, all of which run parallel and warpwise. The main figures
are four, two grotesquely suggestive of a crocodile but more nearly
portraying a turtle, and two that delineate the fanciful figure of a
woman. The intermediate parts of the panels consist of reticulations
whose general design depends upon the skill and whim of the
weaver.<sup>18</sup></p>

<p><sup>18</sup>The cloth is classified (1) according to the color of
the woof threads (<i>pu-gáu-a</i>) into <i>kan-aí-yum</i> (black) and
<i>lin-í-ba</i> (red); (2) according to the design on the central
panel--<i>ím-pis no laí-ag</i> if it is 25 centimeters wide,
<i>bin-a-ga-kís</i> if the central panel is no wider than the lateral
ones; (3) according to the use of narrow (<i>sin-ák-lit</i>) or of broad
(<i>pin-al-áw-an</i>) white stripes; (4) according to the locality in
which the cloth is manufactured, the most famous and most prized cloth
being called <i>ban-a-háw-an</i>, which proceeds from the Banaháwan
district in the Kasaúman River Valley in the southeastern part of
Mindanáo. The Mañg-á-gan type is highly esteemed for being very similar
in design and dye effects to the Banaháwan. It is made by the
<i>Tagabuztai</i> group of Mandáyas in the Karága River Valley.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<h3>PERSONAL ADORNMENT</h3>

<a name="271"></a>
<h4>GENERAL REMARKS</h4>
</center>

<p>The adornment of the person is confined almost exclusively to women
so that the following observations apply principally to them. In the
discussion of bodily mutilations reference will be made to such
permanent adornment as tattooing, perforation and elongation of the ear
lobes, superciliary and axillary depilation, grinding of the teeth, and
the blackening of the teeth and lips--all of which, with the exception
of the elongation of the ear lobes, are common to both men and women.</p>

<p>The finger nails of both sexes are sedulously clipped, not even
thumb-nails being allowed to grow long. This may be due to the fact that
these latter are not required for playing the guitar, nor for gambling
with cards, in which occupations they prove a valuable aid to the Bisáya
of the Agúsan Valley.</p>

<center>
<a name="272"></a>
<h4>HAIR AND HEAD ADORNMENT</h4>

<a name="2721"></a>
<h5>CARE AND ORNAMENTATION OF THE HEAD</h5>
</center>

<p>With the exception of the Manóbos of the far upper reaches of the
Argáwan, Umaíam, and Sábud Rivers, whom I did not visit, and of Manóbos
who live in settlements and may have adopted the hairdressing methods of
Bisáyas, one mode of dressing the hair is almost invariably in use by
both men and women. The hair is parted in a straight line over the
cranium from ear to ear. The front division is then combed forward over
the forehead where it is banged square from ear to ear in the plane of
and parallel to the superciliary ridges. The back division is combed
back, and after being twisted into a compact mass, is tied in a chignon
upon the crown of the head. The knot is a single bow, which from our
standpoint is not very prepossessing.</p>

<p>In men the chignon is usually lower, being about half way between the
crown and the nape of the neck.</p>

<p>One occasionally sees two locks of hair left hanging down in front of
the ears to the level of the jaws. This fashion is not very prevalent
even on the upper Agúsan, and is probably adopted from the Mandáyas.</p>

<p>No fillets, flowers, garlands nor any other ornamentation are ever
used on the hair. Coconut oil, if obtainable, is used, but the meat of
the coconut, rasped or chopped into small particles, is preferred,
whenever it can be obtained. As a wash for the hair, wild lemons, the
seed of an uncommon tree whose name has escaped my memory, and the bark
of a tree, are used sporadically. I can not laud the condition of the
hair. Notwithstanding the fact that a crude bamboo comb with close-set
teeth is made use of, the vermin are never eliminated.</p>

<p>On occasions the hair of children is cut for the purpose of promoting
its growth, and the hair of female slaves is often cut as a punishment.
With these exceptions, the hair is never cut, being left with all the
profusion which nature gives it.</p>

<center>
<a name="2722"></a>
<h5>COMBS</h5>
</center>

<p>An ornamental comb is always worn by women. It consists of a segment
of bamboo, 7 or 8 centimeters long and 5 centimeters high, curved while
still green and made to retain its shape by a slip of bamboo fastened
into two holes on the concave side. The teeth are whittled out and the
upper part and sides are cut into the characteristic shape seen in Plate
9. On the front or convex side of the comb are ornamental incisions the
style and variety of which depend upon the caprice and adeptness of the
fashioner. Skeat and Blagden<sup>1</sup> quote an authority who asserts
that the tribes of the Malay Peninsula attribute magic properties to the
decorative incisions on their combs. Following out this idea, the writer
made numerous inquiries in the Agúsan Valley as to the existence of a
similar or of an analogous attribution but found none. According to all
reports these patterns are purely esthetic in their character, with no
magic or other attributes. The fact that among the Manóbos of the upper
Agúsan in the vicinity of Veruéla, one finds combs without incised work
and among the Manóbos of Argáwan, Umaíam, and Kasilaían one occasionally
sees combs with circular, square, and triangular pieces of
mother-of-pearl inlaid, is an indication of the absence of the aforesaid
belief. In fact, combs of the last-mentioned type seem to be more highly
prized than the plain incised bamboo ones, a fact due probably to the
scarcity of mother-of-pearl. Another point that goes to bear out the
above statement is the fact that no reluctance is displayed in parting
with a comb, no matter how intricate or unusual may be its incisions.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula.</p>

<p>On the upper Agúsan it is not rare to find combs that have a band of
beaten silver with a fretwork pattern laid across the convex part above
the teeth. These combs, however, are imported from the Debabáons of
Moncáyo or from the composite group living farther up the river. The
writer knows of no Manóbo silversmith.</p>

<p>No hairpins nor other means of fastening the hair are made use of,
neither are any dyes nor other materials used to alter its color.</p>

<center>
<a name="2723"></a>
<h5>EAR DISKS</h5>
</center>

<p>Another ornament found on the Manóbo woman's head is the ear disk.
This is a disk of wood<sup>2</sup> about 3 centimeters in diameter, and
6 millimeters wide, with a small groove around the edge in which rests
the edge of the ear perforation. When the wearer has been lucky enough
to get a thin lamina of silver or of gold<sup>3</sup> it is fastened on
the outside of the wooden disk by means of a few strands of imported
cotton yarn nearly always red. The yarn passes through a hole in the
lamina and in the disk, a little tuft being left over the hole. These
metal plates have usually stellate edges and are often decorated with a
simple chiseled pattern. They are rare except on the upper Agúsan where
there are Debabáon and Mandáya smiths. In lieu of gold and silver, a
lamina made out of beaten brass wire answers the purpose.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Usually of <i>ku-li-pá-pa</i>.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Gold laminae are very rare and are seldom parted with.
They are highly valued heirlooms. The silver lamina is beaten out of a
piece of silver money.</p>

<p>On the upper Agúsan both men and women suspend four strings of beads
from each ear, when the dignity of the occasion requires it. These
strings are about 30 centimeters long and have colored cotton tassels at
the ends. Both these tassels and the strings of beads are of the
preferred colors, red, white, black, and yellow. I am inclined to think
that this custom is also of Mandáya origin. Occasionally one or two
buttons<sup>4</sup> are worn in the ear lobes of men on the upper
Agúsan. This practice seems to have been adopted from the Mandáyas.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>Ordinary undershirt buttons.</p>

<center>
<a name="273"></a>
<h4>NECK AND BREAST ORNAMENTS</h4>
</center>

<p>The number of necklets and necklaces worn depends on the wealth of
the wearer or on her good fortune in having been able to secure a supply
of beads. The components of the necklace are principally beads with
alternating odoriferous seeds or pieces of seeds. Here and there a small
shell may be added, or a larger bead, or a crocodile tooth. The writer
has seen worn coils of beads with small shells, seeds, and crocodile
teeth, that must have weighed at least 2 kilograms. Such an array as
this is not worn every day but is reserved for occasions of religious or
secular festivity and for times when the possessor feels bound to make
an unusual display. The seeds worn are the same as those that form part
of the girdle--pendants, above described.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place here to note the fondness displayed by the
feminine portion of the tribe for perfumes. This is characteristic of
all the peoples of eastern Mindanáo with whom I have been in contact.
Though medicinal and magic virtues are attributed, perhaps, to these
odorous seeds, yet their fragrance is also undoubtedly a determining
factor in the choice of them.</p>

<p>In the color of the beads used the Manóbo is restricted by the
character of the supply, but it may be said that where he has his choice
he selects red, yellow, black, and white. He prefers the small seed
bead, but likes to have a few large beads to place at recurring
intervals.</p>

<p>Necklets are occasionally worn. They consist of bands of beads,
arranged symmetrically according to color in geometrical figures--a
triangle of yellow beads, a rectangle of black ones, or other patterns.
This necklet is usually about 2 centimeters broad and long enough to fit
the neck tightly. It is fastened at the back by a button and usually has
a single string of beads depending from it and lying upon the back. Men
may wear this necklet, but its use by them is very infrequent. They,
however, occasionally wear a necklace from which to suspend the hair
eradicator. I observed this only on the upper Agúsan, and, as it is an
ordinary Mandáya practice I suppose that the custom is borrowed--another
indication of the influence of Mandáya culture on the Manóbos of the
upper Agúsan. The eradicator is a small pair of tweezers made,
ordinarily, out of a piece of beaten brass wire bent double and having
inturned edges.</p>

<p>The only breast ornament, besides tattooing on the skin and
embroidery on the jacket, is the silver plaque or disk worn nearly
always by unmarried women and frequently by others. The wearing of these
disks is a custom practiced only on the upper Agúsan, Ihawán, and
Simúlau Rivers, and is without doubt of Mandáya origin. The plaque is a
large thin sheet of beaten silver varying from 7 to 10 centimeters in
diameter. It is of Debabáon or of Mandáya workmanship. It has a pattern
of concentric circles and other symmetrical figures traced upon it,
together with a fretwork of small triangular holes. The more elaborate
ones display an amount of artistic skill that gives the
Mandáya<sup>5</sup> the high reputation that he has in eastern Mindanáo
as a man of superior attainments.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>Mandáyaland produces nearly all the lances, spears,
bolos, daggers, and artistic cloth used by the Manóbos throughout
eastern Mindanáo. Outside of a few silversmiths among the Debabáons, and
a few among the hybrid group occupying the upper Agúsan from Gerona to
Tagaúnud, the Mandáya smiths are the only ones that are skilled in
silverwork.</p>

<h4>ARM AND HAND ORNAMENTATION</h4>
</center>

<p>Men wear on one or both upper arms black bands of braided
<i>nito</i>. These are about 1.5 centimeters in breadth and are braided
into one continuous piece of such a size as to fit the arm tightly. The
writer has seen many that fitted so closely that they caused sores. They
are, besides being distinctly ornamental, designed to serve another
purpose, for they are supposed to impart strength to the muscles.</p>

<p>Men often wear, on one or both wrists, one or more vegetable
ligatures plaited in one continuous piece. These are of a jet black
glossy color when made of the <i>ág-sam</i><sup>6</sup> vine. They are
rectangular in cross section, being about 6 millimeters by 6
millimeters. They must be moistened to make the filaments expand so that
the wearer can pass them over his hands on the wrist. On drying they
contract to the size of the wrist, Women often wear a few of these with
their forearm ornaments.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>Both <i>pug-nút</i> and <i>ág-sam</i> are species of
<i>nito</i> (<i>Lygodium</i> sp.).</p>

<p>Crude rings, round or flat, more commonly beaten out of brass wire or
of copper money, but occasionally made of silver money and still less
occasionally of carabao horn, adorn in greater or less number the
fingers of both men and women.</p>

<p>The forearm adornments of women are more numerous and elaborate than
those of men. Besides the vegetable circlets described above, segments
of the black coral plant,<sup>7</sup> cut into palm lengths and bent
into rings by heating, are worn on either or both arms, though, in case
of an insufficient supply, the left arm is adorned in preference to the
right. These marine ringlets are not solely for purposes of
ornamentation, for a magic influence is attributed to them, at least by
the Manóbos of the upper Agúsan. They are thought to contract and grip,
as it were, the wearer's arm on the approach and in the presence of
danger. Hence they are greatly prized but are comparatively rare. This
is due to the difficulty of obtaining the plant as it grows in deep
water where the danger from sharks deters the native divers.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Called <i>sag-ai-ság-ai</i> in Manóbo and <i>baná-ug</i>
in Bisáya (<i>Antipatharia</i> sp.).</p>

<p>The whorl of a sea shell,<sup>8</sup> ground and polished into white
heavy rings, whose cross section is an isosceles triangle, form a very
common forearm adornment for women on the upper Agúsan. Sometimes as
many as five of these are worn, ordinarily on the left arm. The weight
of a full equipment of shell bracelets may amount to at least a kilo.
The use of such cumbrous adornments is confined to festal occasions
except in the case of unmarried maidens, who nearly always wear them.
These shell bracelets with the black alternating rings of sea coral are
very becoming indeed, as they tend, by the contrast of jet black and
marble white, to set off the color of the skin to advantage.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Tak-lo-bo (<i>Tridacna gigas</i>).</p>

<p>It is noticeable that as one approaches the Mandáya country, the
similarity in dress and personal adornment to that of the Mandáyas
becomes more apparent. This is true on the upper Simúlau, Agúsan, and
Ihawán, another indication of the influence of Mandáya culture on the
Manóbo. Hence in those regions one finds forms of bracelets that are
typical of Mandáya adornment. Thus bands of beaten brass wire, 1
centimeter broad approximately, are seen occasionally. Also flat braided
bands of jungle fiber covered with white beads are sometimes used. On
one occasion the writer saw a hollow circular brass bangle into which a
piece of lead had been inserted, and which with every movement of the
arm produced a tinkling sound.</p>

<p>In the central Agúsan region and among the Manóbos of the Pacific
coast, one finds the use of a small whorl of a sea shell<sup>9</sup> as
a Bracelet but its use is uncommon, especially on the Pacific side. This
is due to the fact that only an occasional shell has made its way into
the country. In these regions the Manóbo is particularly poor in arm
adornments.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>Called <i>lá-gang</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="275"></a>
<h4>KNEE AND ANKLE ADORNMENTS</h4>
</center>

<p>Men, especially unmarried ones, often wear on one or both legs just
below the knee a ligature similar in every respect to that worn on the
upper arms. Its purpose, too, is twofold, to strengthen, and, at the
same time, to adorn the legs. On the upper Agúsan one sees beads sewn on
these bands.</p>

<p>Women have similar ligatures on one or both legs just above the
ankles. They are worn for decorative purposes, but it is said by some
that they are a sign of virginity and that upon marriage it costs the
husband the value of one slave to remove them. But the fact that married
women occasionally wear them seems to contradict this statement.</p>

<p>Women wear at festal periods and especially during dances a few
rings<sup>10</sup> of stout brass wire some 6 millimeters in diameter.
The rings are large enough to allow the foot to be passed through them,
hence they hang loosely at the ankles. In number they rarely exceed two
to each leg. During a dance they tintillate to the jingling of the hawk
bells that depend from the girdle and are considered highly
ornamental.</p>

<h4>BODY MUTILATIONS</h4>

<a name="2761"></a>
<h5>GENERAL REMARKS</h5>
</center>

<p>The purpose of most body mutilations among the Manóbos is
ornamentation. The one exception is circumcision which will be discussed
later.</p>

<p>Scarification is nowhere practiced in eastern Mindanáo except among
the Mamánuas. In 1905 I came in contact with several Mamánuas of the
upper Tágo River (within the jurisdiction of Tándag, Province of
Surigáo) and noticed that they had cicatrices on the breast and arms. I
concluded that the scars were due to the practice of scarification.
Inquiries since that time made among both Manóbos and Bisáyas have
confirmed these conclusions. Head deformation is not practiced in
eastern Mindanáo.</p>

<p>No painting of the body is resorted to other than the blackening of
the lips with soot. To effect this a pot is taken from the fireplace and
the bottom of it is dexterously passed across the lips, leaving a black
coating that, with the fluid from the chewing quid made up of tobacco,
lime, and <i>máu-mau</i> frequently becomes permanent till moistened by
drinking. It is a strange sight to see a handsome Manóbo belle, decked
out with beads and bells, or a dapper Manóbo dandy, take the
<i>olla</i>, and darken the lips.</p>

<p>No religious or magic significance is attributed to any of the
following mutilations, nor are any religious or other celebrations
performed in connection with them.</p>

<center>
<a name="2762"></a>
<h5>MUTILATION OF THE TEETH<sup>11</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>11</sup><i>Há-sa-to-únto</i>.</p>

<p>As the age of puberty approaches, both boys and girls have their
teeth ground. The process is very simple but extremely painful, so much
so that the operation can not be completed at one sitting. I think,
however, that the painfulness of the process depends on the quality of
the stone used, for the Mandáyas of the upper Karága River claim that
there is a species of stone that does not cause much pain.</p>

<p>A piece of wood is inserted between the teeth to keep them apart. The
operator, usually the father, then inserts a small flat piece of
sandstone, such as is used for sharpening bolos, into the mouth and with
a moderate motion grinds the upper and lower incisors to the gums. It is
only the difficulty of reaching the molars that saves them, as the
writer was informed. In all, 10 front teeth disappear, and a portion of
4 others. After filing, the teeth of the upper jaw appear convex and
those of the lower, concave.</p>

<p>I estimate the minimum time necessary to grind the teeth to be from 3
to 6 hours, spread over a period varying from 3 to 10 days.</p>

<p>The patient displays more or less evidence of pain, according to his
powers of endurance but is continually exhorted to be patient so that
his mouth will not look like a dog's. This is the reason universally
asserted for their objection to white, sharp teeth: &#34;They look like
a dog's.&#34;</p>

<p>After each grinding, the subject experiences sensitiveness in the
gums and can not masticate hard food. When this sensitiveness is no
longer felt, usually the following day, the grinding is resumed.</p>

<p>Blackening of the teeth is effected principally by the use of a plant
called <i>máu-mau</i> which, besides being used as a narcotic, has the
property of giving the teeth a rather black appearance. After being
chewed, it is rubbed across the teeth. The juice of the skin is
expressed into a quid of tobacco mixed with lime and pot black, the
whole forming the inseparable companion of the Manóbo man, woman, and
even child. It is a compound about the size of a small marble and is
carried, until it loses its strength and flavor, between the upper lip
and the upper gum, but projecting forward between the lips.</p>

<p>It is to be noted here that the primary object in the use of this
combination is not the discoloration of the teeth. The compound is used
mainly for the stimulating effects it produces, the pot-black being
added as an ingredient in order to blacken the lips and so improve the
personal appearance of the user of it. The quid is frequently carried
behind the ear when circumstances require the use of the mouth for other
purposes.</p>

<p>Another means that helps to stain the teeth is the constant use of
betel nut and betel leaf mixed with lime, and, in certain localities,
with tobacco.</p>

<center>
<a name="2763"></a>
<h5>MUTILATION OF THE EAR LOBES</h5>
</center>

<p>The practice of mutilating the ear lobes<sup>12</sup> is universal
and is not confined to either sex. It consists in piercing the ear lobes
in one, two, or three places. This is done usually at an early age, with
a needle. A thread of <i>abaká</i> fiber is then inserted and prevented
from coining out by putting a tiny pellet of beeswax at each end. As
soon as the wound heals, the perforation is enlarged in the case of a
woman in the following manner: Small pieces of the rib of the rattan
leaf are inserted at intervals of a couple of days until the hole is
opened enough to receive larger pieces. When it has expanded
sufficiently, a small spiral of grass, usually of
<i>pandanus</i><sup>13</sup> is inserted. This, by its natural tendency
to expand, increases the size of the aperture until a larger spiral can
be inserted.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Ti-dáng</i>.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Bá-ui</i> (Bisáya, <i>ba-ló-oi</i>).</p>

<p>The opening is considered of sufficient size and beauty when it is
about 2.5 centimeters in diameter. In addition to this large aperture,
which is located on the lower part of the lobulus, there may be two
other small perforations about 1.5 centimeters further up. These latter
serve both in men and women for the attachment of small buttons, while
the former is confined exclusively to women and serves for the insertion
of ornamental ear disks.</p>

<center>
<a name="2764"></a>
<h5>DEPILATION</h5>
</center>

<p>A beardless face is considered a thing of beauty, so that a
systematic and constant eradication of the face hair is carried on by
the Manóbo from the first moment that hair begins to appear upon his
face. For this purpose he often has a pair of tweezers,<sup>14</sup>
ordinarily made out of beaten brass wire, with which he systematically
plucks out such straggling hairs as he may find upon his upper lip and
on the chin, as well as the axillary hair. The pubic hair is not always
eradicated. A small knife<sup>15</sup> is frequently employed as a
razor, not only on the chin and upper lip but also for shaving the
eyebrows. The removal of the last mentioned is a universal practice, for
hair on the eyebrows is considered very ungraceful. Hence both sexes
shave the eyebrows, leaving only a pencil line, or, in some districts,
not even a trace of hair.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup><i>Pan-úm-pa'</i>.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>Called <i>ba-di'</i> or <i>kám-pit</i>.</p>

<p>The hair on other parts of the body is not abundant and it is not
customary to remove it.</p>

<center>
<a name="2765"></a>
<h5>TATTOOING<sup>16</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>16</sup><i>Pang-o-túb</i>.</p>

<p>After making an infinity of inquiries, I learned that tattooing is
merely for the purpose of ornamentation. By a few I was given to
understand that under the Spanish regime, when killing and capturing was
rife, the tattooing was for the purpose of the identification of a
captive. It was customary to change the name of a captive, and as he was
sold and resold, the only way to identify him was by his tattoo
marks.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the practice seems to have at present no further
significance than that of ornamentation. No therapeutic nor magical nor
ceremonial effects are associated with it. Neither is it symbolic of
prowess, nor distinctive of family, place, nor person, for two persons
from different localities and groups may have the same designs.</p>

<p>No particular age is required for the inception of the process, but
from my observation, corroborated by general testimony, I believe it is
performed usually from the age of puberty onwards.</p>

<p>The operator is nearly always a woman, or a so-called
hermaphrodite,<sup>17</sup> who has acquired a certain amount of skill
in embroidering. These professionals are not numerous, due, possibly, to
the natural aversion felt by women for the sight of blood, as also to
the fact that no remuneration is made for their services, though this
last reason alone would not explain the paucity.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>One meets occasionally among the peoples of eastern
Mindanáo certain individuals who are known by a special name and who are
reputed to be incapable of sexual intercourse. The individuals whom I
saw were most feminine in their ways, preferring to keep the company of
women and to indulge in womanly work rather than to associate with
men.</p>

<p>The process is very simple. A pigment is prepared by holding a plate
or an <i>olla</i>, over a burning torch<sup>18</sup> made of resin until
enough soot has collected. Then without any previous drawing, the
operator punctures, to a depth of approximately 2 millimeters, the part
of the body that is to be tattooed. The blood that flows from these
punctures is wiped off, usually with a bunch of leaves, and a portion of
the soot from the resin is rubbed vigorously into the wounds with the
hand of the operator.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup><i>Saí-yung</i> (<i>Canarium villosum</i>).</p>

<p>The process occupies a variable length of time, depending on the
skill of the operator and on the endurance and patience of the subject.
It is painful, but no such manifestations of pain are made as in teeth
grinding. The portion tattooed is sensitive for about 24 hours, but no
other evil consequences, such as festering, etc., follow as far as my
observations go.</p>

<p>Without the aid of diagrams or pictures it is difficult to describe
in an intelligible and comprehensive manner the numerous designs that
are used in tattooing. Each locality may have its own distinct fashion,
differing from the fashion prevalent in another region. And as the
designs seem to be the result of individual whim and fancy it would be
an almost endless task to describe all of them in detail. Suffice it to
say in general that they follow in both nomenclature and in general
appearance the figures embroidered on jackets, with the important
addition of figures of a crocodile, and of stars and leaves, as is
indicated by the names.<sup>19</sup></p>

<p><sup>19</sup><i>Bin-u-á-ja</i>, (from <i>bu-wá-ja</i>, crocodile),
<i>gin-í-bang</i> (from <i>gí-bang</i>, iguana) and <i>bin-úyo</i> (from
<i>bú-jo'</i>, the betel leaf).</p>

<p>The figures are neither intricate nor grotesque, but simple and
plain, displaying a certain amount of artistic merit for so primitive
and so remote a people. On close inspection they show up in good clear
lines, but at a distance they appear as nothing but dim blue spots or
blotches. For durability they can not be surpassed. No means are known
whereby to eradicate them. I compared tattoo marks on old men with those
on young men and I could not discern any difference in the brightness
nor in the preservation of the design.</p>

<p>In men the portions of the body tattooed are the whole chest, the
upper arms, the forearms, and the fingers. Women on the other hand, in
addition to tattooings on those parts, receive an elaborate design on
the calves, and sometimes on the whole leg.</p>

<center>
<a name="2766"></a>
<h5>CIRCUMCISION<sup>20</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>20</sup><i>Tú-li'</i>.</p>

<p>Unlike the four mutilations already described, circumcision is not
for ornamental purposes. According to the Manóbo's way of thinking it
serves a more utilitarian purpose, for it is supposed to be essential to
the procreation of children. How such a belief first originated I have
been unable to learn, but nevertheless the belief is universal, strong,
and abiding. To be called uncircumcised is one of the greatest
reproaches that can be thrown at a Manóbo, and it is said that he would
stand no chance for marriage unless the operation had been performed;
the womenfolk would laugh and jeer at him. So it may be said that the
custom is obligatory.</p>

<p>The operation is performed a year or two before puberty. No
ceremonies or feasts are held in connection with it. The father, or a
male relative of the child, takes the small knife (<i>ba-dí</i>) and
placing it lengthwise over the lower part of the prepuce, makes a slit
by hitting the back of the knife with a piece of wood or any convenient
object at hand. It thus appears that it is not circumcision in the full
meaning of the word but rather an incision. This operation is confined
to males and is the only sexual mutilation practiced.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<h3>ALIMENTATION</h3>

<a name="281"></a>
<h4>FIRE AND ITS PRODUCTION</h4>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo is unable to explain the nature of fire, but he has two
very primitive but effective ways of producing it, namely, the fire-saw,
and the flint and steel. Owing to the sale of Manila and Japanese
matches to such of the Manóbos as come in contact with traders or with
trading posts, the ancient methods of making fire are falling into
disuse.</p>

<center>
<a name="2811"></a>
<h5>THE FIRE-SAW<sup>1</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Gut-gút-an</i>.</p>

<p>This might be more properly called the friction method, for the fire
is obtained by rubbing edgewise one piece of bamboo at right angles to,
and over the back of, another.</p>

<p>The &#34;saw,&#34; as it is usually called, or upper piece, must be
long enough, say 30 centimeters, to enable one to hold it firmly with
both hands. The breadth is immaterial, provided it be broad enough to
resist the pressure. One edge must be cut sharp.</p>

<p>The &#34;horse,&#34; or lower piece, ought to be at least 10
centimeters broad and of any length. It is essential that the under
surface be sufficiently convex to admit the free passage of air when the
bamboo is placed upon a solid resting place. In the center of this
bamboo is made a hole at least 1 millimeter in diameter. All is now
ready for the operation.</p>

<p>The &#34;horse&#34; is set down upon some clean solid piece of wood
or stone with its inner or concave side downwards, in such a way that it
can not move. The &#34;saw&#34; is placed transversely across the
&#34;horse,&#34; the sharp edge being right over the hole. Holding it
firmly with a hand at each end, it is worked steadily, rapidly and with
great pressure across the &#34;horse,&#34; precisely as if it were
desired to saw it in two. After some 15 strokes, there appears a little
smoke, and the operator increases the rapidity of his movement, until he
thinks that there is sufficient fire underneath the bamboo. Then he
blows down through the hole in order to separate any such bamboo dust as
may still remain in or around it. He removes the &#34;horse&#34;
applying at once a little lint or other tinder to the glowing particles
of bamboo. He then transfers his fire to a piece of good dry wood,
preferably to an old firebrand, and in a few seconds has a permanent
fire.</p>

<p>For the process it is essential that the bamboo selected be dry and
well seasoned, for otherwise the dust produced by the rubbing will not
ignite. There are a few varieties of wood that answer the same purpose,
but I am unable to give the names though I have seen them used.</p>

<center>
<a name="2812"></a>
<h5>THE STEEL AND FLINT PROCESS<sup>2</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>Ti'-ti</i>.</p>

<p>The Manóbo method of making fire with flint and steel differs in no
wise from that used by our own forbears. The tinder used is a fluff
obtained from the sugar palm.<sup>3</sup> It is found around the frond
bases and after being thoroughly dried, is kept with the flint and steel
in a special bamboo or rattan receptacle.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Arenga saccharifera</i>. It is called <i>hi-juíp</i>
or <i>hi-diúp</i> in Manóbo.</p>

<center>
<a name="2813"></a>
<h5>CONTINUATION OF THE FIRE</h5>
</center>

<p>Once lighted, the fire in the house is kept up, ordinarily not for
any ceremonial reason, as far as I have been able to ascertain, but
because it is the custom. It is commonly used to furnish light and is
kept burning during the night for that purpose. In the mountainous
districts, where there is always the possibility of an attack, the fire
is sedulously maintained both for light and heat. On occasions fraught
with danger from malignant spirits, fire is kept burning for ceremonial
reasons as a safeguard against the stealthy approach of the spirits.</p>

<p>Should the fire become extinguished, a fire brand is borrowed from
another house, if there is one in the vicinity, but, if there are no
neighbors recourse is had to one of the above-described methods.</p>

<center>
<a name="282"></a>
<h4>LIGHTING</h4>
</center>

<p>Fire is ordinarily the principal, and not infrequently the only
source of light. It is only in districts in close proximity to the
settlements of Christianized Manóbos that the luxury of coal oil is
enjoyed.</p>

<p>The only source of light in the house, other than that from the fire,
is a species of resin which is collected from a tree that is found in
great abundance in eastern Mindanáo.<sup>4</sup> The method of obtaining
the resin is to make a good cut in the tree about 1 millimeter above the
ground and to catch the resin in a bark or leaf receptacle. This is
usually done overnight. Broken pieces of the resin are then placed in a
conical receptacle, made of green leaves, usually of the rattan, bound
with rattan strips or other vegetable fastening. When needed, the larger
end of this bundle of resin is lighted at the fire and the torch is set
upon the floor supported in a tilted position by the most convenient
object at hand, frequently the whetstone.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>Called <i>sai'-gung</i> or <i>saung</i>. (<i>Oanarium
villosum</i>).</p>

<p>This torch is a good and economical illuminant. It has, however, two
defects: First, the ugly habit of spitting out occasional sparks, which
cause a somewhat painful sore if they happen to hit the flesh; and,
second, a tendency to extinguish itself at intervals on account of the
burnt residue that gradually covers the resin. The ash may be easily
removed with a stick and then the light blazes out at once, casting a
bright glare on the brown and naked figures of the inmates.</p>

<p>When a light is needed for outdoor purposes, a piece of seasoned
bamboo, split at one end, or a firebrand of wood, is carried in lieu of
the resin. It is an invariable custom to carry a firebrand, while
outdoors at night, not only for the purpose of lighting the way but for
daunting the evil spirits that are thought to roam about in the gloom of
night.</p>

<center>
<a name="283"></a>
<h4>CULINARY AND TABLE EQUIPMENT</h4>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo is particularly poor in cooking utensils. With the
exception of a very occasional iron pot, and a much less frequent pan,
he has none of the kitchen apparatus of more civilized peoples.</p>

<p>The earthen pot of his own manufacture is his mainstay. It resembles
the <i>ollas</i> or earthen pots used so universally throughout the
Philippines. In addition to this there is used, though very rarely among
the remote Manóbos, an imported cast-iron pan.<sup>5</sup> It is from 5
centimeters to 10 centimeters in depth and from 25 centimeters to 40
centimeters in diameter, concave, and of the poorest material. It is
used for general cooking, for dyeing, and for making a sugar-cane
beverage. As it is not provided with a cover, the leaves of the bamboo
are used to keep the soot and dirt out and to keep the heat in,
especially in steaming <i>camotes</i> and taro.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>Called <i>ki-ú-ja</i>.</p>

<p>When there are not enough pots for the cooking, as on some
exceptional occasion, green bamboo internodes with one end open are
brought into requisition. Bamboo of the variety known as <i>bo</i> or
<i>bóho</i>, is preferred, for it gives an extra delicate savor to the
contents, as I can testify. Even upon ordinary occasions, fish or meat
is sometimes cooked in bamboo for the same reason. The pieces of bamboo
are put into the fire in a slanting position, the open end being stopped
with leaves. They are turned around occasionally till they are burnt
nearly through. The contents are removed by splitting the charred joint
into strips. These strips are usually given to the expectant children
who scrape and lick them clean.</p>

<p>I once saw the bark of a tree used for cooking rice, but without
success. I was assured that for cooking meat or fish it would answer
admirably.</p>

<p>A ladle, with a handle of wood or bamboo and a head of coconut shell,
is about the only article that the Manóbo ordinarily has to serve the
purpose of spoons and forks. In the absence of the coconut ladle, he
employs the bottom of a bamboo internode to which has been left attached
a strip that serves as a handle. For stirring the rice he uses a little
paddle made out of a flat piece of wood, or if he has no paddle he uses
the handle of his coconut. A coconut shell is used for a water cup,
though, if he has an imported glass, he will offer it to visitors.</p>

<p>No rags are employed in the cleaning of plates and other dishes. At
times a few leaves are required to clean out the iron pan, but for
plates and bowls and other utensils a little cold water and a little
rubbing with the hand are sufficient.</p>

<p>The Manóbo uses no tablecloth nor has he any of the appurtenances
that equip a modern table, except plates, bowls, and, perhaps, a
glass.</p>

<p>Of plates he frequently has too few for his family. Bowls are still
scarcer. Many and many are the houses which I have visited that could
not boast of a single bowl; the same may be said of glasses. This is due
to the exorbitant prices charged for them.</p>

<p>As a substitute for plates, the Manóbo uses platters of bark from the
sago<sup>6</sup> and other palm trees. It may happen on the occasion of
some big festivity that he still finds himself short of plates and
platters, so he utilizes his low panlike weaving baskets by lining them
with banana or other leaves and putting them on the table loaded with
rice. Should all these not be sufficient for the number of his guests,
he spreads out a few banana leaves in the center of the table, or on the
floor, and lays the rice upon them.</p>

<h4>VARIOUS KINDS OF FOOD</h4>
</center>

<p>The great staple of Manóboland is the <i>camote</i>.<sup>7</sup>
During harvest time and for several weeks ensuing rice may constitute
the bulk of his daily food, but after that he reserves for feasts, for
friends, and for the sick what he does not sell, or part with in payment
of debts. Should his <i>camote</i> crop fail he falls back upon the
sago<sup>8</sup> that abounds in the central Agúsan; or, when sago is
not available, he seeks the wild fishtail palm,<sup>9</sup> that affords
him as pleasant and nutritious a food as any sago palm that ever grew.
In the upper Agúsan the Manóbo plants a fair quantity of taro, and in
the middle Agúsan, a small amount of maize in season, or even some
beans,<sup>10</sup> so that it is seldom he has to have recourse to the
forest for his maintenance. But the mountain Manóbo is occasionally
compelled to draw his sustenance from the various palm trees and vines
that are found in such luxuriance throughout his forest domain. I have
seen poisonous tubers gathered in time of famine by the Manóbos of the
upper Wá-wa region and eaten, after they had been scraped on a prickly
rattan branch, and the poison had been removed by a series of washings
and dryings.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>Ipomoea batatas</i> Poir.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Lúm-bia</i>.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup><i>Bá-hi'</i> (<i>Caryota</i> sp.)</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>Called <i>bá-tung</i>.</p>

<p>He nearly always has a little sugar cane on the farm but, when it is
not intended for making an inebriating drink, it is planted only in
sufficient quantity to furnish occasionally a few pieces to the members
of the household.</p>

<p>Besides the above-mentioned plants, he has probably only a few banana
plants, a few ginger plants, some semiwild tomatoes, a little
mint<sup>11</sup> and, perchance, a few other plants intended for
seasoning. He is not accustomed to plant more than will supply the bare
necessities of life.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>Called <i>labwéna</i> probably from the Spanish <i>yerba
buena</i>.</p>

<p>As a concomitant of his rice or <i>camotes</i>, he must have his
<i>is-da</i><sup>12</sup> which he procures from the forest<sup>13</sup>
or from the river.<sup>14</sup></p>

<p><sup>12</sup>This word in its present usage corresponds to the
Spanish <i>vianda</i>, to the Bisáya <i>súdan</i>, and the Tagalog
<i>úlam</i>. Note that the generic word for <i>is-da</i>,
&#34;fish,&#34; has received a still more general application among the
Manóbos and Bisáyas of the middle Agúsan. Originally, no doubt, it meant
simply &#34;fish,&#34; but as the <i>háu-an</i> is almost the only fish
in the middle Agúsan that is caught with frequency and in numbers, the
generic term for fish was narrowed down to this one particular fish.
Thence the application of the word expanded and it now corresponds to
the Tagalog <i>úlam</i> and the Cebu-Bisáya <i>sú-dan</i>.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>See under &#34;Hunting.&#34;</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>See under &#34;Fishing.&#34;</p>

<p>It is not essential that the meat or fish should be fresh. I have
seen pig meat eaten after three days' decomposition. Neither is the
rawness an impediment, for it is customary in certain localities to eat
pork absolutely raw, for ceremonial reasons. Besides pork, venison, and
fish, an occasional wild chicken or other bird snared in the forest, or
a hornbill killed with an arrow, helps to keep his larder supplied.</p>

<p>When no fish or meat has been procured, and this is more often the
rule than the exception, he may have found on his rambles some
mushroomlike fungi,<sup>15</sup> or even mushrooms,<sup>16</sup> or he
may have taken a notion to cut down some palm tree, and get a fine palm
<sup>17</sup> or rattan core <sup>18</sup> or even young bamboo
shoots.<sup>19</sup> While straying along the river bank he may pick
some fern tops of an edible variety.<sup>20</sup> Any of these things
affords as fair supplement to his rice, as butter does to bread. The
palm-tree cores are full of big luscious larvae.<sup>21</sup> He may
have a chance to kill an iguana<sup>22</sup> or monarch
lizard.<sup>23</sup> The killing of a monkey with his bow and arrow, or
in his traps, affords him a choice piece of meat. And when he has the
good fortune to kill a python, he has enough <i>ís-da</i> for himself,
his relatives, and his neighbors for at least one meal. Occasionally,
during the proper season, he locates a bees' nest and therefrom procures
an amount of honey, larvae, and beebread that proves an uncommon treat
for himself and his family. Again, on the river at certain periods he
has nothing else to do except to scoop into his dugout (if he has one)
the exhausted &#34;water-skimmers,&#34;<sup>24</sup> or while passing
near some sand bank to spy the spot where the water lizard buried her
delicious eggs. In the little side streams he may catch a few frogs and
go on his way rejoicing.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>These are a variety of insect called <i>dá-li</i>, of a
whitish color about 2 centimeters long, and having two threadlike
appendages extending from the posterior part. They are eaten raw,
usually with vinegar and salt. This insect is said to be, probably, one
of the Neuroptera or Pseudoneuroptera.</p>

<p>With these random finds, with wild boar and deer that come from an
occasional chase, with such salted and dried fish, including jerked
crocodile, as he may purchase directly or indirectly from Bisáya traders
or from Christianized Manóbos, and with a casual pig or fowl killed on
ceremonial or festival occasions, he manages to keep his family fairly
well supplied with an accompaniment for the mess of rice or other staple
food.</p>

<p>Salt, the native red pepper,<sup>25</sup> and at times ginger
constitute a very important part of the meal, if they are obtainable.
The first mentioned article is far from being abundant, especially in
certain localities, such as the Baóbo River and the upper parts of the
Ihawán, Umaíam, and Bahaían Rivers. In such places as these the writer
found such an intense craving for it that it was eaten ravenously and
declared to be &#34;sweet.&#34;</p>

<p>There is such an inordinate desire for salt, especially the rock salt
made out of salt water and ash lye, that the Manóbo will submit
sometimes to tyranny and to the most exorbitant rates in order to obtain
it. This craving for salt will explain the general preference that is
felt for salted food as against fresh meat. The small salted fish,
peddled in such quantities by Bisáya traders, are prized above the
choicest pieces of venison and jerked crocodile, presumably for the salt
that they contain. It may be wondered why the Manóbo does not salt his
own meat and fish, but this is explained by the fact that such an
operation is strictly tabooed.</p>

<p>Red pepper is a <i>sine qua non</i>. It is eaten much as we eat salt,
and is said to impart courage. In the regions near the Mandáyas it is
put up in a special form,<sup>26</sup> this being nothing more than the
dried pepper pounded, mixed with salt, and preserved in bamboo joints in
a dry place, usually in the smoke above the hearth. In this condition it
acquires an extraordinary strength that makes the plain red pepper taste
mild. This is explained, perhaps, by the fact that in the pounding the
seeds of the pepper are triturated.</p>

<h4>THE PREPARATION AND COOKING OF FOOD</h4>

<a name="2851"></a>
<h5>PREPARING THE FOOD</h5>
</center>

<p>The remote preparation consists in getting a supply of sweet potatoes
or rice from the farm. This may be a mile or more from the house, so
that once a day at least the women, with baskets on their heads and
paddles in their hands, if they live on navigable water, leave for the
farm. In localities where an ambush is a possible contingency, a few men
with lance and shield, and hunting dogs accompany the women as a guard,
for the <i>camote</i> field is a favorite spot for the enemy to wreak
his vengeance, according to the recognized laws of Manóboland. The women
and girls dig up the <i>camotes</i> with a bolo or with a small pointed
stick, and get a little rice from the granary.<sup>27</sup> After
performing any necessary work such as weeding and planting, they return
and prepare the meal, the men taking no part except to clean and quarter
the game or other meat that may have been selected for it.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup><i>Tam-bó-bung</i>.</p>

<p>The preparation of pigs and fowls is such a frequent occurrence in
Manóboland, as also among Bisáyas, Mañgguáñgans, Debabáons, and Mandáyas
of the Agúsan Valley, that it merits a detailed description.</p>

<p>In preparing a pig, wild boar, or deer, a rough support, consisting
of four vertical pieces of wood and a few horizontal parallel pieces, is
erected outside the house, if the weather permits. A fire is built
beneath the frame and the whole animal, minus the entrails, is laid upon
it. Two men or more then set to work with pieces of wood, sharpened
lengthwise, and scrape off the hair as fast as it becomes well singed.
The operation lasts only about 15 minutes in the case of a large animal.
When the hair has been removed the carcass is given a washing more or
less thorough, according to the amount of water conveniently available,
and the quartering begins.</p>

<p>The game is laid upon leaves; the four legs are removed in order; the
head is chopped off; the ribs and remaining parts are hacked crossbone.
During this operation the family dogs usually cause an infinite amount
of trouble by their incessant attempts to secure a piece of the meat.</p>

<p>If the meat is for distribution, as it always is, except on occasions
of festivity or of sacrifice, it is scrupulously divided at this moment.
If it is for a feast, it is hacked up into small pieces and loaded into
earthen pots, iron pans, and bamboo joints. The dogs are then allowed to
lick the blood-stained leaves and to clean the floor.</p>

<p>The preparation of a domestic fowl is also left to the men and
deserves a few words. When the fowl is not killed sacrificially, it is
burnt to death. Catching the chicken firmly by the feet and wings with
one hand and by the head and neck with the other, the owner singes it
over the fire till it shows no more signs of life. It may be thought
that this is a cruel way of killing an animal, for it kicks and twists
and flutters unless firmly held, but the Manóbo is not allowed by his
tribal institutions to kill the fowl as other peoples do. To cut off the
head is strictly tabooed, a cruel and unbecoming procedure, for there is
no one &#34;to revenge the deed,&#34; he will tell you. So he chokes and
burns it to death. All signs of life being extinct, he pulls out a few
of the tail and wing feathers. I can give no reason for this procedure,
but as the custom is so universal, I think it has a peculiar
significance of its own.</p>

<p>As the singeing proceeds, the feather ends are plucked out and a.
cursory washing given the fowl. The entrails, even the intestines with
the exception of the gall bladder, are removed and utilized. Finally the
head, the ends of the wings, and the lower parts of the legs are cut
off, and ordinarily are given to the children who have been anxiously
awaiting such delicacies.</p>

<p>The pounding and winnowing of the rice is such a common and important
operation in the whole of eastern Mindanáo that it deserves special
mention.</p>

<p>As the rice used by the mountain Manóbos is exclusively of their own
harvesting, it must be hulled, a process that is performed just before
every meal wherein it is used. The implements are a wooden mortar and a
few heavy wooden pestles. The mortar is a piece of wood of varying
dimensions, in the center of which is hollowed out, by burning and
cutting, a conical hole, whose depth averages 24 centimeters in height
and whose diameter is about 20 centimeters. One sees from time to time a
mortar with two holes, or one on which there is evidence of an attempt
at artistic effect by means of primitive carving, but, in the main, the
mortar is a rough-hewn log with a conical hole in it and with the upper
surface so cut that the paddy or rice will have a tendency to fall back
into the hole.</p>

<p>The pestle is a pole, preferably and usually of heavy hardwood, about
1.5 meters long and 20 centimeters in circumference. It is a marked
exception to find pestles decorated in any way. On the Umaíam River I
saw one the end of which had been carved in open fretwork with a round
loose piece of wood within the fretwork, a device that was as useful as
it was ornamental, for the wooden ball by its rattling within the
fretwork cage served to animate the holder and her companions to
vigorous and constant strokes.</p>

<p>The following is the process of hulling: The mortar is more than half
filled with unhulled rice. One or more women or girls grasp the pestles
in the middle with one hand. One begins by driving down her pestle with
force upon the paddy. Then another, and still another, if there be
three. It stands to reason that, since the hole in the mortar is small,
the most exact time must be kept, otherwise the pestles would interfere
with one another. The sound made by the falling pestles often resembles
that general but strange beat so prevalent in Manóbo drum rhythm. A
visitor who has once seen three Manóbo women dressed in gala attire,
with coils of beads and necklets, ply their pestles in response to the
animated tattoo on the drum will never forget the scene. The pestles are
tossed from one hand to the other to afford an instant's rest. They bob
up and down with indescribable rapidity and in perfect rhythm as if they
were being plied on some imaginary drum.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, from 5 to 15, the hull is shattered from the rice
and one of the women bends down and with her hands removes the contents
of the mortar to the winnowing tray. After winnowing, they repeat the
process till all the husk has been separated from the grain. They then
pound a new supply until there is enough rice for the purpose in view.
The husk has been shattered from the grain as perfectly, though not as
quickly, as if it had been done by a machine.</p>

<p>The winnowing tray is a round shallow tray, 40 centimeters in
diameter and usually of plaited rattan strips with a rim of thicker
rattan. It is held in both hands and by a series of shuffling motions,
which are better seen than described, accompained[sic] by a peculiar
movement of the thumb of the left hand, the chaff and the little broken
fragments of rice are thrown off into another receptacle for the family
pigs.</p>

<center>
<a name="2852"></a>
<h5>COOKING THE FOOD</h5>
</center>

<p>Rice is not usually washed before cooking. It is put into a homemade
earthen pot,<sup>28</sup> which is often lined with sugarcane leaves,
not only to prevent the rice from burning, but to impart to it a finer
flavor. It is covered with water, the rice being about 5 centimeters
below the surface of the water. The pot is set on a hot fire until the
water evaporates to the level of the surface of the rice, whereupon the
greater part of the fire is removed and the rice is allowed to steam
dry. These remarks also apply to the cooking of a variety of
millet,<sup>29</sup> which is sown sparingly with the rice.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup><i>Kó-don</i>.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup><i>Daú-wa</i>.</p>

<p>Another method of cooking rice, especially when on the trail, is in
green bamboo. Joints of green bamboo are filled with rice and water, or
rice is wrapped in rattan leaves and then packages are put into the
water. Rice cooked in this latter way will keep for three days.</p>

<p>There are two orthodox methods of cooking fish and meat and no other
is admissible, under penalty of infringing a very important taboo. One
method consists of boiling them in water, with a little seasoning of red
pepper, ginger, and possibly lemon grass and one or two other
ingredients. The second method consists of broiling the pieces of meat
and fish in or over the fire. Meat and fish already cooked are thrown
into the fire in order to heat them. The fact that they may be burnt and
covered with ashes does not detract from the flavor. The most usual
method of broiling, however, is to put the meat on skewers of wood or
bamboo a few inches above the fire.</p>

<p>When large game has been secured at such a distance from the house
that it must be cooked in the forest, it is cut into quarters, and
broiled over a heaping fire. This is the invariable method of cooking
the heads even of domestic pigs. Chicken heads, legs, and wing ends are
invariably broiled, while the intestines are wrapped up in leaves and
cooked better than might be supposed, though the flavor, to my taste, is
not the most delicate. They seem, however, to be a choice morsel to the
majority of my Manóbo friends. Monkeys, frogs, and the forest carrion
lizard are always broiled.</p>

<p><i>Camotes</i> and taro are usually cooked unpeeled in the common
earthen pot. About a half a liter of water is used in an ordinary pot,
so that the process is practically one of steaming. If the pot has no
cover, or if the imported pan be used, leaves are employed to confine
the heat.</p>

<p>A favorite dish of the Manóbo and an indispensable one of the Mandáya
is the famous <i>á-pai</i>.<sup>30</sup> This consists of taro tops
(stem and leaves) cut up fine and cooked with water, red pepper, mint,
semiwild tomatoes, and any other vegetable seasoning which may be on
hand. This makes a very palatable and wholesome dish.</p>

<h4>FOOD RESTRICTIONS AND TABOOS</h4>
</center>

<p>Certain birds such as the hornbill, wild chicken, varieties of wild
pigeons, and a few others, must not be divided and given to anyone else
before eating. They must be cooked by the broiling method <sup>31</sup>
and not in water. After cooking, these birds can not be partaken of by
anyone who is not a relative or a member of the household. Neither
should a part of a bird belonging to a stranger be accepted or partaken
of. The whole bird or nothing must be offered. An infringement of these
restrictions would lead, it is believed, to serious
results,<sup>32</sup> such as ill luck to the hunting dogs, tangling of
the snares, and other misfortunes.<sup>33</sup></p>

<p><sup>31</sup><i>Dáng-dang</i>.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup><i>Ma-ko-lí-hi</i>.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup>In the upper Agúsan the partition of such small birds
would lead, I was told, to a dismemberment of the family.</p>

<p>An unmarried man who has ever made indecent suggestions to a woman is
prohibited from eating wild-boar meat. The guilty one must free himself
from this restriction by making a small present to a priestess. A
violation of this taboo would be prejudicial to the success of the
hunting dogs.</p>

<p>The use of lard in cooking is interdicted, but it may be eaten raw,
even when its smell is not the most wholesome.</p>

<p>On a few occasions, I noticed that some individuals abstained from
rice or from chicken. I was unable to elicit any other reason for the
abstinence than the good pleasure of the persons concerned. As they
admitted that they had been accustomed to use these foods and would use
them again after certain periods, I suspect religious motives for the
abstinence.</p>

<center>
<a name="287"></a>
<h4>MEALS</h4>

<a name="2871"></a>
<h5>ORDINARY MEALS</h5>
</center>

<p>Though it may be said that three meals a day are not the rule among
the Manóbos, yet they eat the equivalent of three or more, for between
pieces of sugarcane and munchings of wild fruit,<sup>34</sup> they keep
replenishing the inner man pretty constantly. They eat breakfast at
about 9 o'clock in the morning, dinner about 1 p. m., and supper at any
hour between 6 and 9 p. m.</p>

<p><sup>34</sup>There are many wild fruits in the Agúsan Valley, the
most common of which are: The famous durian (<i>Durio zibethinus</i>),
the jackfruit, <i>lanka</i> (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i> l. f.),
<i>lanzones</i> (<i>Lansium domesticum</i> Jack.), <i>makópa</i>
(<i>Eugenia javanica</i> Lam.), <i>mámbug</i>, <i>támbis</i>,
<i>kandíis</i>, <i>kátom</i> (<i>Dillenia</i> sp.), and the fruit of the
rattan (<i>kápi</i>). Most of these are of a sour acid nature but for
this reason seem to be relished all the more.</p>

<p>All being ready for the meal, the inmates of the house squat down
upon the floor, the husband with his wife and children apart, male
visitors and the unmarried portion of the house eating together. Slaves
eat when all have finished, and get what is left in the pots.</p>

<p>Just before beginning to eat, the host and, in fact, everybody except
the women, tenders to visitors and others who have come in an invitation
to join in the meal and nobody will begin to eat till everybody else has
squatted down and is ready. Once the meal is begun, no one leaves, nor
is it good etiquette to call anyone from his meal.</p>

<p>The hands are washed by pouring a little water upon them from a bowl,
tumbler, coconut shell, or piece of bamboo; the mouth is rinsed, the
water being ejected, frequently with force, through the interstices of
the floor. Then all begin to eat. It is the invariable rule for men to
eat with the left hand, and where others than relatives are present, to
wear a weapon of defense, the right hand resting upon it in anticipation
of a possible attack.</p>

<p>The various articles of food have already been set on the floor in
the various receptacles heretofore described. Each one falls to with an
appetite that can hardly be described. One or more of the womenfolk keep
the wants of the diners supplied. The method of eating rice among the
mountain Manóbos differs from that prevalent among the Christian tribes.
A good-sized mass of rice is pressed together between the five fingers
of the left hand and pushed up into the palm where it is made into a
ball. Thence it is conveyed to the mouth. At intervals the rice (or
<i>camote</i>) is flavored with a little accompaniment of meat or fish,
and all is washed down with the soup of the meat or fish.</p>

<p>The custom of sipping, with a sucking sound, the scalding soup from a
plate or bowl and of then passing it on to one's neighbor is almost
universal. Great predilection is shown for this soup, even though it be,
as happens in a great many instances, practically nothing but hot water.
In the upper Agúsan, the taro-top soup previously mentioned is the
ordinary soup and substitute for meat and fish.</p>

<p>Another peculiar feature in eating is the method of cutting meat from
the bone. The carver, who is in a squatting position with his feet close
to the body, holds the bolo with the handle between the big first toe in
a vertical position, the back of it being toward him. He draws the meat
over the edge, thereby doing the carving in a quicker, more convenient,
and more effective manner than do a great many more civilized men.</p>

<p>No one may retire from the meal without giving notice to his
neighbors. A violation of this custom constitutes a gross breach of
Manóbo etiquette. The reason for this custom is that the chances for a
sudden attack are thereby lessened.</p>

<p>It is not polite to remain seated in the same place after a meal. If
the place can not be changed, it is necessary to rise and then sit down
again. I can give no explanation for the practice, unless it be a
precaution against treachery.</p>

<center>
<a name="2872"></a>
<h5>FESTIVE MEALS</h5>
</center>

<p>Festive meals are indulged in more especially on the occurrence of
the great religious and social celebrations that recur with such
frequency in the Manóbo world. The arrival of a visitor, or even an
unusual catch of fish, is also an occasion for such enjoyments. I have
had ample opportunities of witnessing them, because during a trading
expedition I was frequently honored with invitations, the reason for
which was, of course, to secure from me good bargains, or credit.</p>

<p>Before the meal the house is a scene of indescribable animation. The
guests, together with the members of the household, rarely number less
than 20 and may reach 100 or more. The pig is cooked in bamboo joints,
earthern[sic] pots and iron pans, both in the host's house and, if
necessary, in neighboring houses. The same may be said of the rice and
<i>camotes</i>. If the host has enough drink, and if there is a little
meat or fish to serve as a lunch, he has the food brought out and orders
a part of the drink to be distributed to the guests according to their
importance. Joyous laughter and loud conversation, together with chewing
of tobacco and betel nut, fill up the interval before the meal.</p>

<p>When all is ready, the available number of plates, bowls, glasses,
bark platters, and leaves are set out and the boiled meat is apportioned
in small pieces, with great exactitude as to size and quality, to the
several plates. The same thing is done for the broiled meat after it has
been hacked into suitable sizes. No one is forgotten, not even the
children of the guests, nor the slaves. The rice is then brought along
in bamboo joints, in pots, and even in baskets lined with leaves, and to
each person is assigned a heaping portion. When all has been impartially
and equally distributed, the guests are bidden to take their places on
the floor, each one at his appointed plate, for where visitors other
than relatives are present, no precaution is omitted to safeguard the
guests against trouble. Experience has proved that the festive board may
be tinged with blood before the end. This even distribution of the food
and the collocation of the guests often occupies the better part of an
hour. If these duties are not properly performed envious feelings and a
quarrel might ensue before the end of the meal. The guest of honor is
always given preference and the host may also especially favor others
whom he may have reason to honor but he always makes public the reason
for his partiality.</p>

<p>All being seated the meal begins with a goodly quaff of homemade
brew. Then all begin to eat. As the feasters warm under the kindling
influence of the drink, they express their good will by giving material
tokens, each one to his friend or to one whose friendship he desires to
gain. These tokens consist of handfuls of meat--lean, fat, bone,
gristle, or anything--smeared with salt and pepper, and bestowed by one
friend into the mouth of another without any consideration of the
proportion existing between the size of the mouth and the size of the
gift. It is not good etiquette to refuse this gift or to remove it from
the mouth. This offering is followed probably by a bamboo jointful of
beverage which must be received in the same friendly spirit and is
gulped down with a mumbled expression corresponding to our &#34;Here
goes.&#34; The recipient of these favors returns the courtesy in kind,
and so the meal goes on in mutual goodfellowship[sic] and congeniality
till the food has completely disappeared, for it is against the
conventionalities of Manóbodom to leave a scrap on the plate. Indeed the
Manóbo loves a good eater and drinker. It is an honor to gorge and a
glory to get drunk. Now it happens at times at a Manóbo banquet, as it
does in all drinking bouts the world over, that a quarrel ensues and
recourse is had to the ever present bolo to settle an argument that wild
shouts and frantic gestures can not decide. For this reason the Manóbo
eats with his left hand and rolls his eyes from side to side in constant
vigilance.</p>

<p>These remarks do not apply to the women and children, who sit apart
in little groups of their own, and, while feasting one another in their
own gentle way, attend to the shouts for more food when they are heard
above the din of the revellers.</p>

<p>During the course of a feast of this kind an observer is struck with
the hearty appetite exhibited by these primitive people. Man vies with
man in holding out. Friend honors friend with plenteous bestowals of
food and drink and the host strives to induce his guests to eat to their
utmost capacity. Rarely does one see a Manóbo troubled with nausea but,
if he is, he returns later to the feast, to finish his appointed
portion. I have seen this happen on occasions.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<h3>NARCOTIC AND STIMULATING ENJOYMENTS</h3>

<a name="291"></a>
<h4>DRINKS USED BY THE MANÓBOS</h4>
</center>

<p>Intoxicating drinks are of four kinds: Sugar-palm wine,<sup>1</sup>
<i>bá-hi</i> toddy,<sup>2</sup> sugarcane brew,<sup>3</sup> and
mead.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Tuba</i> or <i>sai-yan</i> or <i>san</i>, the sap of
the <i>hi-di-up</i> (<i>Arenga saccharifera</i>) commonly known in the
Philippines as <i>cabo negro</i>.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>The fishtail palm (<i>Caryota</i> sp.). The extracted sap
is called <i>túng-gang</i>.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Ín-tus</i>.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>Bá-is</i> or <i>bi-aí-lis</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="2911"></a>
<h5>SUGAR-PALM WINE</h5>
</center>

<p>Sugar-palm wine is obtained by tapping the fruit stem of the cabo
negro palm. The process is very simple. At the time of efflorescence the
spadix is cut off and the pithy stem is tapped. This operation lasts
from 15 to 30 minutes each day and is continued for from 7 to 14 days.
After the tapping the stem must be bent into a downward position. This
is effected by inclining it downward every day, a piece of rattan or
vine being used to retain it in position. The gentlest of force must be
used in this operation, as a forcible strain will prevent the sap from
flowing. Once the sap begins to flow from the stem, it is caught in a
bamboo receptacle, the mouth of which must be carefully covered to
prevent the entrance of the myriads of insects that are attracted by the
odor and sweetness of the liquid. Day after day the end of the stem must
be pared as otherwise the sap would cease to exude. A tree will produce
daily anywhere from 10 to 30 liters according to the fertility of the
soil and the humidity of the atmosphere. The humidity determines the
duration of time that the tree produces toddy. This time varies from one
to three months.</p>

<p>The sap has the color and transparency of water to which a little
milk has been added. When fresh, it is a sweet, refreshing laxative, but
the fermentation is so rapid that after a few hours it acquires the
inebriating qualities of ordinary coconut toddy. In order to promote
fermentation and to eliminate the laxative quality of the sap, the
bark<sup>5</sup> of a tree is added. On the third day acetification
begins to take place, unless a handful of the ordinary native red pepper
is thrown into the beverage, in which case the further fermentation is
withheld for a period of about four more days.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>Called <i>la-gúd</i>.</p>

<p>The palm from which this sap is obtained is found in great abundance
on the eastern<sup>6</sup> side of the lower and middle Agúsan Valley
and is universally tapped in this region. On the western side, however,
it is not found with such frequency. The Manóbo is therefore obliged to
seek other means of satisfying the craving which he, like a good many of
his fellowmen the world over, feels for a stimulant.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>In the vicinity of Tudela, Simúlau River, there are
groves of sugar-palm. I estimated that they contained 5,000 trees.</p>

<center>
<a name="2912"></a>
<h5>BÁHI TODDY</h5>
</center>

<p><i>Túng-gang</i> is the sap of the <i>báhi</i> palm. The method of
extraction is identical with that of the sugar-palm wine. It is neither
as pleasant nor as strong as the previously described drink, but it is
not by any manner of means unwholesome. It is employed as a beverage
only when no other is obtainable. I have been reliably informed that
sometimes the tree is cut down as a preliminary to the extraction of the
sap. Incisions are made in the trunk for the purpose of permitting the
flow of the sap.</p>

<center>
<a name="2913"></a>
<h5>SUGARCANE BREW</h5>
</center>

<p><i>In-tus</i> is a beverage made out of the juice of the sugarcane.
It is the most common and the most popular drink, so much so that it is
deemed worthy of being presented to the spirits on sacrificial and other
occasions.</p>

<a name="29131"></a>
<p><i>Extraction of the juice</i>.--The sugarcane is first peeled and
then crushed, stalk by stalk, or piece by piece, under the li-gi-san.
This is a very primitive mill, consisting of a round, smooth, heavy log
usually of <i>palma brava</i><sup>7</sup> or of the fishtail palm, set
horizontally about 1 meter above the ground on two crude frames. It is
provided with a vertical handle, by means of which it can be rolled from
side to side over a fiat piece of wood. The cane is introduced gradually
between this latter piece and the log, which is kept in constant motion.
As soon as the whole or a part of a piece of cane has been crushed, it
is doubled up into a mass about 30 centimeters long and is again
crushed. By this method about 20 liters of juice are obtained in a
day.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>An-a-hau</i> (<i>Livistona</i> sp.).</p>

<a name="29132"></a>
<p><i>Boiling</i>.--The iron cooking pan described in a previous chapter
is preferred for preparing the drink, unless an empty kerosene can has
been secured. In the absence of both, the ordinary pot answers the
purpose. In the center of the cooking utensil is placed a small cylinder
made of slats of bamboo to serve for gaging the amount of evaporation.
The boiling vessel is filled with small slices of the root of a
gingerlike plant<sup>8</sup> and sugarcane juice is added to fill the
interstices.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Lan-kwas</i> (<i>Cordeline terminalis</i> Willd.).</p>

<p>The amount of boiling determines the quality of the resulting liquor.
If the sap is boiled down only one-fourth, the drink produced is of a
sweetish taste and of a whitish appearance and, in my estimation, is not
palatable. The more the sap is evaporated, the more it mellows and
browns. The Manóbos of the upper Agúsan make a better drink than those
of the lake region for the reason that they evaporate the juice
one-half, while those of the latter-mentioned district only give it a
cursory boiling. It is usual to employ a little gaging rod of bamboo for
measuring the amount of evaporation, this being done by inserting it
into the bamboo cylinder in the center of the pot, but an old hand at
brewing can gage by the smell.</p>

<a name="29133"></a>
<p><i>Fermentation</i>.--After cooking, the decoction is unfit for
immediate use. It must be left to undergo fermentation for at least
three whole days. Five days are sufficient to render it fairly
drinkable. The longer the period of fermentation, the liner the quality
of the resulting liquor, <i>ceteris paribus</i>. When well-cooked brew
has been kept for a few months, it assumes a translucid amber color,
smells and tastes strongly of rum, and is highly intoxicating. The
liquor during fermentation must be kept in closed jars or earthen pots
in a cool moist place. If kept in bamboo joints, it will spoil.</p>

<p>In general, the drink is more intoxicating than coconut toddy, but it
is wholesome, and its use is not attended by the after effects that are
the result of overindulgence in certain other alcoholic drinks like
<i>vino</i>. In this connection it may be well to remark that I have
never observed a case of delirium tremens nor of any of the other
serious consequences that in other parts of the world frequently afflict
the habitual drinker. The only ill effects I have seen are the
proverbial headache and thirst, but even these are very rare and usually
occur only after periods of long and uninterrupted indulgence. As a rule
such effects are at once dispelled by taking hot taro-top soup or by
munching sugarcane.</p>

<center>
<a name="2914"></a>
<h5>MEAD</h5>
</center>

<p>This is probably the finest beverage produced in Manóboland, but as
the honey season is short and as the honey is consumed, both in the
forest after taking the nest and in the house by the members of the
family, the drink is scarce.</p>

<p>The preparation of the drink is identical with that of sugarcane
brew. The same ferment is used, the same method of cooking is employed,
and in general the same remarks apply, with the exception that in place
of the sugarcane juice, honey and water are used. The honey is mixed
with water in varying proportions. It is the proportion of water to
honey that determines the strength, quality, and flavor of the final
drink, A mixture of half and half is said to yield the best beverage. If
fermentation is allowed to continue for a few months, the resulting
liquor is of a clear crystalline color, and will compare both in flavor
and strength with those more up to date.</p>

<center>
<a name="292"></a>
<h4>DRINKING</h4>

<a name="2921"></a>
<h5>GENERAL REMARKS</h5>
</center>

<p>Though the Manóbos invariably drink during religious feasts, yet
neither during the feast itself, nor in the preparation of the toddy,
have I ever observed any religious ceremony nor were any magic or other
preternatural means employed. It is true that when the crushing
appliance<sup>9</sup> is set up, the fowl-waving ceremony, followed by
the blood unction, is performed. I witnessed this ceremony myself in
several parts of the Agúsan River Valley. But such ceremonies are
customary on the erection of houses, smithies, and so forth, and bear no
relation to the actual production of the drink.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup><i>Li-gi-san</i>.</p>

<p>During religious ceremonies a bowlful of the brew is set out with the
usual viands, such as meat and rice, for the <i>di-u-a-ia</i>,
<i>tag-la-nu-a</i> (lords of the hills and the valleys), and for other
spirits, for they, too, like to be regaled with the good things of this
world.</p>

<p>Drink is taken on the occurrence of all the great religious and
social feasts and upon the arrival of a distinguished friend or
visitor--also when it is desired to make a good bargain or to secure any
other end by convivial means. The acquisition of an unusual amount of
fish or of meat is a common occasion for the making of the brew and
gives rise to the following practice:</p>

<center>
<a name="2922"></a>
<h5>THE SUMSÚM-AN</h5>
</center>

<p>The <i>sumsúm-an</i>, i. e., the eating of meat or fish with an
accompaniment of drink, a universal practice throughout the Agúsan
Valley, the Salúg Valley, and the whole Mandáya country, is a thing that
appeals especially to the true Mandáya, Manóbo, and Mañgguáñgan. When a
man of one of these tribes has secured a good catch of fish, or has
trapped a wild boar, he procures a supply of beverage and meets his
guests at the appointed place, usually his little farmhouse. As soon as
all are assembled, the fish or the meat is broiled on sticks of wood
over the fire. When it is cooked, the women lay it out and it is slashed
into pieces, usually by the host, and apportioned with great precision
as to weight, quality, amount of bone, and quantity of inept. During
this operation, a few bamboo jointfuls of brew are brought from some
hiding place and a relative of the householder sits down with one under
his arm. Before him are set such articles as glasses and bowls, if
obtainable, or in lieu thereof, small pieces of bamboo joints, each
holding about a tumblerful, and not very different in shape from
handleless German steins. These bamboo cups admirably fulfill the
purpose. The distributor of the liquor slices a little strip from under
the mouth of his bamboo deposit to prevent loss of the liquor during
pouring, then he inserts two fingers into the mouth of the bamboo and
makes an opening through the leaves for the drink, but not so large as
to give free exit to such insects as may have found their way into the
liquid. He then fills up the vessels at hand, taking care to give to
each an equal amount.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that it is an inviolable custom that the host
drinks first. This is because of the widespread belief in secret
poisons. After drinking the host passes the cup to those whom he wishes
to honor, unless they are already provided, and using some expression
corresponding to our English &#34;Here goes,&#34; the guest or guests
quaff the brew. The bowls or other vessels are returned to the
distributor, and the process is repeated until all have had a drink.</p>

<center>
<a name="2923"></a>
<h5>DRINKING DURING RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL FEASTS</h5>
</center>

<p>During religious and social feasts the drinking customs are as above
described, except that the beverage is set out in sacred jars, when on
hand, and with such an array of bowls as the host may possess. One of
these feasts, notably the marriage feast, may be attended by as many as
200 persons and last from 3 to 7 days and nights, so that to hear of 20
jars or 100 bamboo<sup>10</sup> jointfuls of sugarcane brew being
consumed on the occasion of a great festival is not strange.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup><i>Sugúng</i>.</p>

<p>The amount of drink used, both individually and collectively during
one of the feasts, gives one an idea of the great capacity which these
primitive peoples enjoy. The average white man in my opinion would be
deliriously drunk before the Mandáya or Manóbo would be feeling merry.
It is not according to tribal customs to refuse food and drink as long
as the host has them to set before his guest. On a few occasions I have
seen a tribesman rise, quietly empty the stomach, and calmly return to
the feast to finish his appointed portion and wash his hands and his
plate as an evidence of that fact.</p>

<p>With regard to women and children, it may be said that they drink
little, not from any religious or moral principles, but simply because
they do not care to. The men, however, are inveterate drinkers. No
disgrace is attached to drunkenness. On the contrary to take the
allotted portion is considered a duty and a virtue.</p>

<center>
<a name="2924"></a>
<h5>EVIL EFFECTS FROM DRINKING</h5>
</center>

<p>It goes without saying that quarrels sometimes result from these
drinking bouts, though not oftener, I venture to say, than among more
highly cultured peoples in other parts of the world. The custom of
carrying weapons on all occasions where others than relatives are
present has a deterrent effect on quarreling, yet there are occasions
when daggers or bolos terminate an argument that wild shouts and frantic
gestures can not settle.</p>

<p>With regard to the amount of drink consumed, I could as well venture
an approximation as to the number of stars in the firmament. This will
be readily understood when one is told, that according to the social
institutions of the Manóbos, it is considered no breach of manners to
ask a neighbor for any thing of his to which one may take a fancy. A
refusal on his part, unless couched in the most diplomatic terms, might
give rise to unneighborly feelings and prompt a reprisal in kind on some
other occasion. Hence drink is almost invariably kept deposited in the
grass outside of the settlement. When it is needed it is brought to the
appointed place secretly or at night, for were others than the invited
ones aware of the existence of drink in one's possession they, too,
would flock to the scene. In view of the secrecy maintained about the
possession of drink it is impossible to give an estimate of the amount
of liquor consumed in Manóboland. Suffice it to say that the Manóbo
drinks on every possible occasion and will travel many a mile to secure
a little of the flowing bowl.</p>

<center>
<a name="293"></a>
<h4>TOBACCO PREPARATION AND USE</h4>
</center>

<p>When the tobacco is ripe, it is gathered, cut fine with a sliver of
bamboo, and dried in the sun for a day or two. It is then frequently
pounded into bamboo internodes and laid away in a cool, dry place, often
in the rice granary, for fermentation. Before using the tobacco it is
customary to set it out in the grass for a night or two. This causes a
sweating and makes the tobacco fit for chewing.</p>

<p>This is the only form in which tobacco is prepared among the mountain
Manóbos. The quantity of tobacco raised is insignificant, being a little
more than is sufficient for their personal use. As they dispose of a
great deal of it during harvest time, it not infrequently comes to pass
that there is a dearth long before the next crop.</p>

<p>No harmful effects are attributed to the use of tobacco, though from
childhood to the grave it is made use of by men, women, and children.</p>

<p>Only men and boys smoke. The pipe employed for this purpose is
commonly a little cone made out of a piece of imported tin or of a piece
of steel. The stem is a piece of small bamboo. One occasionally finds
wooden pipes, but they have probably been acquired from Christianized
Manóbos or from Bisáyas.</p>

<p>The first-mentioned pipe holds about one thimbleful of tobacco. It is
usually lighted with a firebrand, unless it is used when the people are
on the trail; at such a time the flint, steel, and tinder are called
into requisition.</p>

<p>There are two forms of tobacco chewing: First, the <i>bal-ut</i>
method. In this a mixture is made of minced tobacco, lime, the juice of
a vine,<sup>11</sup> and pot black. This combination, which in bulk may
be the size of a large marble, is carried between the upper lip and the
upper gums but resting upon the lower lip and projecting out of the
mouth, thereby keeping the lips apart. It is made use of principally for
its narcotic qualities, but at the same time it serves as an ornament
and tends to blacken the teeth. It is carried in the mouth until its
strength is exhausted. During meals it is placed behind the ear. When
tobacco is scarce, the same quid receives several additions of lime, pot
black, and vine juice, so that it may be used for a whole day. The women
are more accustomed than the men to the use of this <i>bal-ut</i>, for
the reason that the former do not smoke, and also because they usually
have hidden away a less limited supply of tobacco than the men. The
second method of using tobacco is known as the <i>la-gút</i>. This
consists of chewing a little pinch of tobacco in combination with betel
nut. Tobacco is seldom chewed alone.</p>

<a name="294"></a>
<h4>THE BETEL-NUT MASTICATORY</h4>

<a name="2941"></a>
<h5>INGREDIENTS AND EFFECT OF THE QUID</h5>
</center>

<p>The betel-nut quid is to the Manóbo more than the cigarette, cigar,
or pipe is to his more civilized fellow man. With him the use of it is a
universal, eternal habit. By day and by night, in the house and on the
trail, in health and in sickness, he turns for stimulation to the quid
of betel nut, betel leaf, and lime. A visitor comes to his house and the
first act of hospitality is the offering of the betel-nut quid. He meets
an acquaintance upon the trail, and he sits down and offers the soothing
chew. He is anxious that his omen be good and he lays a tribute of betel
nut upon the trail for the forest deity, and goes on, confident that his
desires will be fulfilled. And when he calls upon his gods, the first
and most essential offering must be the quid of betel nut, for the
fragrance of the nut and the redolence of the blossom are said to be the
chief delicacy of the spirits.</p>

<p>The betel nut<sup>12</sup> is obtained from the palms found in the
forest. These palms were planted either by the Manóbos themselves or by
their ancestors. The nuts are found in scarcely sufficient quantity to
supply the demand. When they can not be obtained, other plants
<sup>13</sup> are used, but they are an inferior substitute. In taste
the betel nut is exceedingly astringent and can not be used except in
combination with the betel leaf and lime. As a rule the green and tender
nut is preferred by the mountain Manóbos, but the ripe nut seems to be
the choice of those who have come in contact with Christianized Manóbos
or with Bisáyas.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Areca betel</i>.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Kan-ín-yag</i>, cinnamon, is one of the substitutes.
Also called <i>kanéla</i>.</p>

<p>The betel leaf<sup>14</sup> is from a species of pepper, of which
there are innumerable species both domestic and wild. A domestic variety
is preferred but, since the supply is not always equal to the demand, as
in the case of the betel nut, the wild species afford a tolerable
substitute. The tender leaves are preferred as being less pungent. For
the same reason domestic species are used in preference to the wild
ones, these latter possessing a highly acrid taste.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup><i>Betel</i> sp.</p>

<p>The lime is made from the shells of shellfish found in the rivers,
streams, and lakes. The shells are burnt in a very hot fire, usually of
bamboo strips, the fire being fanned continually. The shells are then
slaked with a sprinkling of water and the lime is ready for use.</p>

<p>To prepare the quid, the betel nut, frequently stripped of its
fibrous rind, is cut into small slices. One slice is laid upon a piece
of betel leaf, and a little lime is shaken upon it from the lime tube.
The leaf is then wrapped around the nut and the lime, and the pellet is
ready for use. The amount of lime must be such that the saliva will turn
red, and depends upon the size of the betel nut and the betel leaf. An
excess of lime burns the integuments of the mouth and tongue, but this
is avoided by increasing immediately the amount of leaf. A little pinch
of tobacco, the stronger the better, completes the ordinary quid.</p>

<p>There are sometimes added to this masticatory certain other aromatic
ingredients, such as cinnamon, lemon rind, and other things.</p>

<p>The first and immediate effect of chewing this combination is to
promote salivation. Following this is the reddening of the saliva by the
chemical action of the lime upon the betel nut and the leaf. However,
the most important effect produced by the quid is the soothing sensation
that follows its use. In this respect it far exceeds tobacco chewing,
both in the Manóbos' opinion and in my own. The sensations which I
experienced on my first trials were a feeling of inflation of the head
and a transient sensation of weakness, accompanied by a cold sweat upon
the forehead. This was followed by a feeling of exhilaration and
quickened vitality. It may be said in general that betel-nut chewing
acts as an efficacious restorative, especially during a journey, and as
a harmless narcotic which it would be hard to replace. The addition of
tobacco intensifies this narcotic effect considerably, other additions
such as cinnamon serving only to soften the astringency and the piquancy
of the leaf and to impart an aroma to the quid.</p>

<center>
<a name="2942"></a>
<h5>BETEL CHEWING ACCESSORIES</h5>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo man carries on his back, in a little bag <sup>15</sup> of
<i>abaká</i> or other cloth, all the requisites for betel-nut chewing.
The woman deposits them in an open basket unless she is on a journey, in
which case she carries them in a little closed basket.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup><i>Pú-yo</i>.</p>

<p>The betel nut and the betel leaf are put into the bottom of the sack
for the purpose of concealment, for there is a continual clamor for one
or the other, and should it be known that a certain individual has a
supply, the Manóbos' social regulations would oblige him to part with it
upon request. Hence he keeps it out of view, and is always ready to
excuse himself, when asked for one or the other, on the ground that he
has no more.</p>

<p>He keeps a few nuts and leaves for immediate use in a Moro brass
box,<sup>16</sup> if he is so fortunate as to possess one. Otherwise he
puts them in a cylindrical receptacle <sup>17</sup> usually made out of
a small bamboo internode, or in a little round receptacle <sup>18</sup>
of plaited rattan coated with the pulp of the seed of a
tree.<sup>19</sup> His tobacco for immediate use he keeps in another
similar receptacle, the main supply being hidden away in the bottom of
the knapsack.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup><i>Ta-bon-tábon</i> (<i>Parinarium mindanaense</i>
Perkins).</p>

<p>The lime is invariably kept in a small internode <sup>20</sup> of
bamboo. This is open at one end and has a spherical plug of plaited
rattan inserted into the mouth for the purpose of preventing an excess
of lime from issuing. This spherical network resembles in miniature the
football seen so commonly throughout the Philippines. When it is desired
to add lime to the quid, the tube is taken in one hand and held in a
downward position with the thumb and little finger underneath it and the
other fingers above it. The first finger is then made to slide with
force from the middle finger down to the tube, thereby tapping out the
lime. This tapping motion is similar to that performed when winnowing
rice.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup><i>Táng-tang</i>.</p>

<p>The men use their bolos to cut up the betel nut, but the women have a
small knife <sup>21</sup> which also answers the purpose of a general
utility implement corresponding to our scissors.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup><i>Ba-di'</i> or <i>kam-pit</i>.</p>

<p>When the chewer's teeth have deteriorated from age, the quid is
mashed in a small mortar made of hardwood, a piece of steel serving as a
pestle. In this way the betel nut and leaf are rendered sufficiently
soft for mastication.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be said that though the habit seems a dirty
one, owing to the discoloration of the mouth and lips of the chewer and
to the ruby expectorations that tinge his surroundings, yet on the whole
it is a necessary and beneficial practice. From my observation and
experience, I believe that the habit eliminates toothache and other
disorders of the teeth. Christianized Manóbos and Bisáyas who have
relinquished the habit suffer from dental troubles, whereas the
inveterate chewer of the mountains is free from them. The Manóbo can not
endure the long and frequent hikes, nor carry the heavy loads that he
does, without this mild but efficacious restorative.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<h3>MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE</h3>

<a name="2A1"></a>
<h4>AGRICULTURE</h4>

<a name="2A11"></a>
<h5>GENERAL REMARKS</h5>
</center>

<p>Agriculture is in a very primitive condition. It is true that most of
the Christianized Manóbos living in the river settlements have a few
hundred <i>abaká</i> plants each, yet the care of them is left
practically to nature, their productivity depending upon the soil. But
the true mountaineer plants nothing except the bare necessities of
life--rice and <i>camotes</i>, some taro,<sup>1</sup> a little sugarcane
in season, a little patch of maize, and sometimes ginger and other
spices.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>In districts close to the Mandáya country the use of taro
is more common, but even in the upper Agúsan it is not a permanent crop.
The Mandáyas subsist to a great extent on it whenever the soil is
adapted to its growth. Taro is the <i>Colocasia antiquorum</i>.</p>

<p>His system of agriculture is in perfect adaptation to his social and
political institutions. Living as he does in a state of eternal
vigilance, and knowing that the first death in the house or an unlucky
combination of omens or the menaces of his enemies may drive him from
his home and from his farm, he is content with a small clearing. He
builds no embankments, no irrigation ditches, no terraces. He has no
plows, nor draft animals. He selects a patch of the virgin forest every
year, and with the bolo and rude axe, clears and cultivates the land.
For a permanent crop he keeps his <i>camote</i> patch, on which he may
plant a few bananas and also invariably a sprinkling of sugarcane.
Scattered around this small farm may be found some native tomatoes, more
often planted by the birds than by the hand of man, a few ginger and
other plants that serve to season the food. A betel-nut palm is planted
occasionally, and some betel leaf, but with these exceptions no trees,
not even those whose fruit is dearly relished, are planted.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A12"></a>
<h5>THE TIME AND PLACE FOR PLANTING RICE</h5>
</center>

<p>The time for planting is at hand when the voice of the bird
<i>kuaháu</i> first breaks from the forest and the leaves of
<i>lanípau</i> tree begin to fall.<sup>2</sup> Then the farmer hies to
the woods to select the site for the rice field, calling upon the omen
bird to direct him in his choice. Of course he is governed in his
selection by reasons of proximity to water, safety from floods, distance
from the settlement, etc., but the omen bird's cry must be favorable.
Having decided on the location he makes an offering of betel nut to the
<i>tagbánua</i> and to such other spirits as may dwell in the
neighborhood. This act of homage is performed in order to make friends
with these forest lords so that they may not be displeased on account of
the usurpation of a part of their domain. Then he selects a spot for the
house and clears it, if he has time, but if not, he cuts down a few
small trees as a public notice of his proprietorship. Special attention
is here called to the fact that the spot selected must be one of virgin
forest. The Manóbo never plants his rice in the same place during two
successive years, because it would not yield a plentiful harvest.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Certain trees, such as the <i>ná-to'</i> and the
<i>ba-ró-bo'</i>, begin to fruit at this season, and are also signs of
the approach of the rice-planting season.</p>

<p>The following day, or when all is ready, he and his household begin
the work by erecting a small shack sufficiently large to accommodate
them. In the middle of the farm<sup>3</sup> is erected a small platform
for the seed and, near the house, the usual offering house<sup>4</sup>
and other sacrificial perquisites. Then he is ready to perform the
rice-planting sacrifice.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>U-ma'</i>.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>Ka-má-lig</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A13"></a>
<h5>THE SOWING CEREMONY<sup>5</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>5</sup>The <i>täp-hag</i> sacrifice.</p>

<p>Täphágan is a female <i>diuata</i> under whose special
superintendence are placed the rice crop and all that pertains to it.
She is thought to guard the crop against man and beast, even revealing,
it is said, to her chosen ones the names of all trespassers. In return
for this she must be frequently feasted from the beginning of the rice
season up to the harvest, for at that time her duties cease, and she
yields the field to Hakiádan.</p>

<p>The officiant in the rice-planting ceremonies is either one or more
family priests. The victim is either a pig or a fowl, sacrificed in a
special manner. The invocations consist of the same interminable
supplications, promises, and repetitions that are characteristic of all
Manóbo prayers. One variation is observed during this ceremony. The
fowl, on being killed, is thrown on the ground and left to flutter
around, thereby, it is thought, removing from the soil with its blood
such evils as might harm the rice or lessen its production. If a pig,
however, has been killed the blood lustration is performed in the
ordinary way by smearing a near-by log, the priest bidding the
evil<sup>6</sup> of the earth begone. I have often been told that a
special ceremony is necessary at the time of rice planting. This
ceremony is called <i>hú-gad to sá-ya</i> or <i>hú-gad to sä</i> which
means &#34;to cleanse the sin.&#34; I am inclined to think that this
rite is a purificatory one, as the name of it indicates. I suppose that
it is a secret expiation of such transgressions as might be punished by
a failure of the future crop.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup><i>Ka-dú-ut</i>.</p>

<p>As in all undertakings of import, the entrails of the victim are
carefully observed. Other forms of divination, especially the egg omen,
are employed to determine whether the supernal powers approve the site
or not.</p>

<p>Among the offerings to Täphágan is a handful of unhulled rice taken
from the last harvesting and now set out in the religious shed. It is
customary during this feast to give a little rice to such animals and
insects as are liable to harm the crop later on. Among these may be
mentioned rats, ricebirds, crows, parrakeets[sic],<sup>7</sup> and ants.
A little rice is set out on a log for them and they are bidden welcome,
and requested not to commit any future depredations. Nor are the omen
birds, prophets of plentiful crops, and the <i>kuaháu</i>, harbinger and
companion of the rice crop, forgotten.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>Abúkai</i>.</p>

<p>During the growth of the rice the above practices are observed from
time to time. No special rule is observed, but it may be said, in
general, that the occurrence of ill omens, or the suspicion of danger,
urge the owner of the crop to feast Täphágan and thereby obtain immunity
from evil. The priest is the best judge as to the necessity of such
things.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A14"></a>
<h5>THE CLEARING OF THE LAND</h5>
</center>

<p>The omens being favorable, the farmer, assisted by his relatives and
friends, begins the clearing without delay. It is essential that at
least a little work be done in order to clinch the bargain with the
powers above, for should a delay occur the omens might go awry and
necessitate a repetition of the ceremonies and even an abandonment of
the farm. I heard of several cases where prospective farms were
abandoned under these circumstances.</p>

<p>The clearing, like all other agricultural operations, is done on the
mutual-help system,<sup>8</sup> that is, the farmer's relatives and
friends unite to help him clear the land, which favor he and his family
is expected to return in kind.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Pag-a-bai-yús-an</i>.</p>

<p>The average clearing does not comprise more than a few acres, and is
completed ordinarily in from two to five days. The first step
<sup>9</sup> in the clearing process consists in cutting down the
underbrush and small trees. In this the men are assisted by the women
and children who gather these into heaps for burning. This may take only
a few days, if no inauspicious omens occur, but, according to my
observation, it is seldom that some omen or other does not interfere
with the work. Thus a dead animal, such as a wild boar, or snake, found
on the farm makes blood lustrations necessary. The rumbling of thunder
means a temporary discontinuance of the work, and often a purificatory
ceremony, of which I can give no details, becomes necessary and delays
the work.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>Called <i>gás</i> or <i>gái-as</i>.</p>

<p>The next operation consists in the felling of trees.<sup>10</sup> For
this purpose, scaffolds, usually of bamboo, are erected around the tree
at a height several feet above the buttresses of the tree or at such a
point as is considered expedient. Trees are cut down high above the base
because the wood at the bottom of the tree is usually exceedingly tough.
Standing on his perch at a distance of about 8 feet from the ground, the
feller plies his native axe<sup>11</sup> until the tree yields and
crashes down in its fall such of its fellows as may stand in its way. It
may be observed here that the Manóbo as a rule is an expert at tree
felling and takes great pleasure in it. Practically all the felling and
clearing of Bisáya land in the Agúsan Valley is done by Manóbos of
Christian or of pagan persuasion and at a merely nominal cost.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup><i>Gú-ba</i>.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup><i>Hu-wá-siu</i>.</p>

<p>After the trees have been cut down, all branches and parts of the
tree that would be too much of an obstruction in the farm are
cut<sup>12</sup> and mounted into heaps for future burning.<sup>13</sup>
This burning, of course, can not take place till after the hot
weather,<sup>14</sup> which comes at this period and lasts about a
month. Unless the clearing was exceptionally free from heavy timber, the
ground remains encumbered with the larger trunks and branches, even
after the burning, but this is no impediment, for the rice and
<i>camotes</i> can be planted between the stumps.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Gú-ang</i>.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Sáng-ag</i>.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup><i>Gu-yá-bang</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A15"></a>
<h5>THE SOWING OF THE RICE AND ITS CULTURE</h5>
</center>

<p>It is essential that the sowing take place between the time of the
burning and the next full moon. But the exact date varies according to
the locality. Thus, in Umaíam district, the time for sowing is said to
be the ninth day after the first waning moon that follows that spell of
hot weather, known as <i>guyábang</i>, whereas in the upper Agúsan 12
nights are counted from the first new moon after the <i>guyábang</i> and
the sowing takes place the following day. It is thought that this
procedure will insure a plentiful crop.</p>

<p>The method of sowing is simple. The owner of the farm takes a handful
of rice from the woven-grass<sup>15</sup> bag in the center of the
clearing and scatters it broadcast. Then the members of the family
complete the sowing. There seems to be a knack in so scattering the seed
that it may not cover the ground too closely. Once cast upon the
surface, the seed is covered<sup>16</sup> immediately so as to get it
under the ground and away from the ravages of vermin. This is done by
breaking the ground slightly with bolos.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup><i>Kam-bu-yaí</i>.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>The process of covering the seed is called
<i>hi-la-bón</i>.</p>

<p>As a protection against weeds, <i>camotes</i>, sugarcane, and even
maize are planted in places where the rice is not so close, and
especially where the weeds have sprung up. These latter must be removed
from time to time until the crop is sufficiently tall to shade the
ground. This and all subsequent work connected with the farm, except the
making of wild-boar traps and the caring for them, falls upon the women
and children.</p>

<p>The growth of the rice is carefully observed, and the owner of the
farm must be ever ready to counteract evil indications and to feast
Täphágan upon their appearance. Thus finding a dead animal, such as a
large bird, lizard, or monkey, is considered of ill import and
lustration of blood must be resorted to. Again the appearance of certain
birds in the vicinity of the farm is looked upon as of evil omen, and it
becomes necessary to drive away the impending evil by proper ceremonial
means.</p>

<p>Drought, though an uncommon occurrence, is especially feared. I once
witnessed a peculiar method of rain making. It was performed under the
auspices of Täphágan and in the following manner: The rain
makers<sup>17</sup> each secured a frond of some palm tree and went to
the bank of the stream near by. Here they beat their fronds upon the
surface of the water until the leaves were torn. Then each one stuck his
frond upon the bank in a vertical position and went his way, certain
that rain would follow.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup><i>Mig-pa-áyao</i>.</p>

<p>There are, on the other hand, divers good omens and indications of a
plenteous harvest. The swarming of bees on the farm is one of these. So
is the continuous cry of <i>kuaháu</i>. There are many other omens both
good and evil that render the growing season one of constant question
and answer between nature and primitive man. As the time for the harvest
approaches, means must be taken to protect the crop against its enemies.
Traps and light fences are the principal defense against wild boar.
Scarecrows, consisting of pieces of palm frond, tin cans, and other
things, are suspended from long rattan cords that diverge in all
directions from the watch house <sup>18</sup> in the center of the
field. The waving of these rattan strips, when manipulated by the young
person on watch, accompanied by loud yells, serve to frighten away the
ricebirds,<sup>19</sup> parrakeets[sic], and monkeys. A little offering
of rice is frequently made by way of gaining the good will and speedy
departure of the latter.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup><i>Ban-taí-an</i>.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup><i>Máya</i>.</p>

<p>A final feast, similar to that described in the preceding pages, is
given to Täphágan by way of thanksgiving, when the crop is nearly ripe
for the harvest, and she then passes out of the Manóbo's memory for
another year.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A16"></a>
<h5>THE RICE HARVEST</h5>
</center>

<p>The harvest time is the merriest of all the year. It ends, in most
cases, the long period of abstinence from rice, and many times
terminates a period of actual hunger. It is the season for the
celebration of marriages, with their attendant festivals; for hunting
and for fishing, especially with poison. And yet it is fraught with
religious fear and safeguarded by severe taboos and other restrictions
that make it to some extent a season of mystery. In many places it is a
time of vigilance against the attacks of the enemy.</p>

<p>The first thing that must be done when the rice is ripe enough to
harvest is to close all trails leading to the house and farm. No one may
now, under penalty of a fine, enter the precincts, nor may any one but
an inmate of the household be present, for otherwise the crop might
never come to maturity.<sup>20</sup> Should any one trespass upon the
farm, it is imperative that work be discontinued until the following
day. This gives a good opportunity to collect the fine imposed on the
trespasser. I did not care to violate this taboo, and for this reason
can offer only second-hand information as to what takes place from the
time of the closing of the trails till the harvest feast.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup><i>Makadúya</i> is the term used to express the evil
that might befall the crop.</p>

<p>The owner makes solemn invocation to the omen bird and, if the omens
are satisfactory, proceeds to cut some of the ripe heads of rice in the
center of the farm. These are then put into a grass bag prepared
especially for this purpose. This bag is said to have bezoar
stones<sup>21</sup> placed in it in order that the rice may not only not
diminish but may even increase in quantity. For the six following days
the women and children reap a little every day and deposit the rice in
the above receptacle.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup><i>Mút-ja</i> or <i>mút-da</i>.</p>

<p>The rice thus harvested is carefully preserved as seed for the
following year, though a little of it may be employed for ceremonial
purposes during the sowing and harvesting celebrations. The new rice
must on no account be eaten before the harvest feast is ready, and it
must not be given away, for that would certainly result in a mysterious
decrease.<sup>22</sup> In fine, it has such a sacred character that it
must be pounded at night and never in the presence of anyone who is not
a member of the household, for should anyone visit the house at this
time the rice would be found to have much chaff<sup>23</sup> in it.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup><i>Ka-gu-yú-dun</i>, i. e., literally, that it would be
pulled away.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup><i>Á-pa</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A17"></a>
<h5>THE HARVEST FEAST</h5>
</center>

<p>The harvest feast must take place before the real work of harvesting
begins. It usually occurs on the seventh day after the closing of the
trails, if everything is in readiness. The importance of this feast is
such that he who can not kill a pig for the occasion has no title to
aristocracy in the tribe. All being ready, the trails are opened and the
drum and gong boom out to announce to relatives and friends that they
are welcome to the feast of Hakiádan, the goddess of grain.</p>

<p>The ceremony differs but little from that to Täphágan, as described
on previous pages. The invocation to Hakiádan is most elaborate, lasting
for several hours in the few instances which I witnessed. It is taken up
by one priest after another and every inducement is offered to Hakiádan
to prevent the rice from being stolen, or destroyed by their enemies,
carried away by floods, wet by rain, raided by rats and ants, or stolen
by Dágau, that fickle mischievous spirit whose pleasure seems to be to
bring hunger <sup>24</sup> to humankind. The dead, whose final
feast<sup>25</sup> has not yet been celebrated, are given a betel-nut
offering and requested most devoutly not to tamper with the rice. Even
the greedy parrakeets[sic], the gregarious ricebirds, and other enemies
of the rice have portions of the first fruits set out for them in little
leaf packages. Hakiádan is asked to instruct these creatures to behave
themselves during this delicate season.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup><i>Ma-ka-bun-tas-úi</i>.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup><i>Ka-ta-pús-an</i>.</p>

<p>The pig is killed in the ordinary way, and the feast ends with the
usual revels. When the farmer is unable to procure a pig, a chicken is
substituted, specious excuses being made for the failure to provide a
larger victim.</p>

<p>After the celebration the women and children of the household,
assisted by such of their friends and relatives, women and children, as
have agreed to harvest the rice, begin the work in real earnest. Each
one starts out with her basket hanging upon her back, supported by the
string which passes over her head. In her hand she carries the
harvesting knife, which is a clamshell set at right angles in a palm's
length of rattan, or in lieu of the shell a similarly shaped piece of
tin. With this she snips off a ripe ear with a few inches of the stalk
and throws it into her basket, which now hangs from her shoulder. When
her basket is full she returns to the place where a larger
basket<sup>26</sup> has been set and deposits her load in it. Thus the
process goes on for the few days (three to five) necessary to harvest
the crop.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup><i>Diwítan</i>.</p>

<p>The men in the meantime make the granary <sup>27</sup> somewhere in
the clearing, usually in the center. It is ordinarily a crude structure
consisting of four small posts, upon which rests a roof of rattan leaf
thatch. Intermediate between the roof and the ground is a floor either
of bamboo slats or of bark, upon which are set the cylindrical bark or
grass receptacles for the rice. Sometimes wooden disks or inverted cones
of bamboo slatwork are attached to the posts of the rice granary to
prevent the entrance of rats and mice.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup><i>Tam-bó-bung</i>.</p>

<p>The rice in the larger baskets is brought to the granary and in the
course of a few days is put on coarse mats of grass and threshed with
hands and feet. It is then spread out thinly on these same mats and
dried in the sun for one day. After it is dried it is cleaned of chaff
by being tossed into the air from the winnowing tray. It is then ready
for permanent deposit in the granary, to be disposed of later either by
sale or by home consumption.</p>

<p>A field 1 hectare in area will yield, at a low estimate, 25 sacks,
but where the soil is particularly well adapted for rice culture, as it
is on the upper parts of nearly every river in the Agúsan Valley, 50
sacks are not considered an extraordinary yield.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A18"></a>
<h5>THE CULTURE OF OTHER CROPS</h5>
</center>

<p>The rice straw that stands upon the field is burnt down, and sweet
potatoes, some maize, a score or more of sugarcane plants, a patch of
taro, and sometimes a few banana plants are put in at intervals after
the harvest entertainments. The time selected for the planting of
sugarcane and bananas is around noon. It is thought that, if planted
then, they will grow taller and bigger than if planted at any other
hour. Taro and corn, on the contrary, must be planted during the morning
hours, probably for some reason analogous to the above. If the rumbling
of thunder is heard during the planting of these crops, it is an
intimation that the planting should be discontinued till the following
day, or, in case of urgency, till proper omens be taken to ascertain the
attitude of the powers above.</p>

<p>Fruit trees of divers kinds are found scattered throughout the broad
expanse of forest that covers eastern Mindanáo, but they are not of
man's sowing nor does the Manóbo ever lay claim to them. He takes the
fruit, frequently branch and all, eats it, throws the seed away and goes
his way rejoicing.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A2"></a>
<h4>HUNTING</h4>
</center>

<p>The Manóbos are excellent hunters, keen, clever, determined, and
enduring, but by no means incessant. In fact, it is only under the
stress of hunger or when a few of them rally together that they start
off with hunting spears and dogs. Occasionally one meets a professional
who takes pride in the business, as may be observed by the trophies of
wild-boar tusks and jaws hung in his house.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A21"></a>
<h5>HUNTING WITH DOGS</h5>
</center>

<p>The dogs used are of the usual type seen throughout the Philippines,
except that only the better and pluckier or luckier ones are chosen for
hunting. These are recognized by the size and relative position of the
nipples on the breast. It is said that from these and other marks the
fate of the dog can be foreseen. I was frequently instructed in these
signs, but found it impossible to master them for the simple reason that
no two experts seemed to agree. Thus in one case, where I consulted
those versed in this matter, they respectively informed me that a
certain dog would be mangled <sup>28</sup> by a wild boar, swallowed by
an alligator,<sup>29</sup> and devoured by a cobra, and advised me not
to purchase it. Good hunting dogs are often valued as highly as a human
life (30 pesos) and sometimes more so. I have seen dogs that seldom
returned without having run down a deer or wild boar.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup><i>Pan-ii-gón-on</i>.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup><i>Si-bad-ón-on to bu-a-ja</i> (<i>budáa</i>).</p>

<p>The ordinary Manóbo house has at least a few dogs, and these are
allowed the liberty of the house. They share the family mats, and
sometimes have a special ladder provided for their ascent and descent.
Their food at the best is somewhat scanty. They have names such as
&#34;Diguim,&#34;<sup>30</sup> &#34;Sápas,&#34;<sup>31</sup> and are
addressed by their masters with the greatest familiarity. A dog,
however, that howls in its sleep, is thought to forebode the death of
its master or of some inmate of the house. It must be sold, else the
owner or one of his family might die. Dogs are supposed to be messengers
of the blood spirits <sup>32</sup> and to be under the protection of the
god of hunting,<sup>33</sup> for whom the following ceremony must be
made by the hunter if he desires continued success in the chase and the
safety of his dogs from the perils thereof.</p>

<h5>OFFERING TO SUGÚDUN, THE SPIRIT OF HUNTERS</h5>
</center>

<p>A triangular tray of <i>bayug</i> or of <i>ilang-ilang</i> wood
decorated with palm fronds is made and suspended from the rafters of the
house. The owner of the dogs then calls upon Sugúdun, offers him a quid
of betel nut, and promises to kill a fowl if only he will be so kind as
to assist in getting a wild boar or a deer the following day. The fowl
must be a male and of a red color. This invocation occupies the better
part of an hour, and, when the hunter is satisfied that he has convinced
Sugúdun of the necessity and expediency of being propitious, he slays
the red fowl in his honor. The blood is caught in a sacred saucer
<sup>34</sup> and placed upon the oblation tray<sup>35</sup> for the
special entertainment of the hunting deity. In one case I saw the blood
anointment<sup>36</sup> made on the principal dog in order to remove
from him some evil influence that he was thought to possess. After the
fowl is cooked, a piece of the meat, a little cooked rice, and a few
eggs are put upon the sacrificial tray and left there.</p>

<a name="2A23"></a>
<h5>THE HUNT</h5>
</center>

<p>On one of the ensuing days, provided he has observed no ill omen, the
hunter starts off, usually with one or more companions, for the selected
hunting grounds. As the forests of the Agúsan Valley teem with wild boar
and deer, the hunters usually do not have to travel far before the dogs
get on the scent. This they announce by their continuous yelping. The
hunt then begins. The game strives to elude its pursuers by constantly
doubling on its path, so that the hunters do not have such a long run as
might be imagined. They never cease to encourage their dogs with a
peculiar monotonous cry that resembles a long-drawn <i>u</i> sound. The
dogs keep on the heels of their prey and worry and harass it with
repeated snaps and bites till it finally comes to bay with its back to a
tree. The hunters at once become aware of this by the change in the cry
of the dogs, and, accordingly, hasten their steps. Upon arriving at the
scene, they cautiously steal up behind the game and put it to death with
their spears.</p>

<p>Accidents are uncommon during the hunt, but I have seen several in
which both men and dogs were mangled by some fierce wild boar that on
being wounded had proved a dangerous enemy.</p>

<p>Where several hunters have participated in the hunt, the game is
divided in the forest according to the number of dogs engaged. If the
hunters are relatives of the same household, as generally happens, the
distribution is made after they reach home. The game is carried back by
one of the party, and, if there are other relatives in the settlement,
they, too, receive a share. Thus a wild boar or a deer is sufficient for

<h5>HUNTING TABOOS AND BELIEFS</h5>
</center>

<p>The following taboos in connection with hunting are of interest:</p>

<blockquote><p>(1) The mention of such things as are displeasing to the
local forest deities must be positively avoided, such as the mention of
salt, of fish that are not found in the region, and of the name of the
quarry.</p>

<p>(2) The meat must not be cooked with lard, garlic, or in any other
way except in the orthodox Manóbo manner of broiling it, or cooking it
in water.</p>

<p>(3) The meat must not be salted and dried.</p>

<p>(4) The game must not be skinned, but singed, for the former act
would be one of rashness that would incur divine displeasure and result
in lack of success on the part of the dogs during all ensuing hunts.</p>

<p>(5) The bones of the game must not be rapped on the floor to remove
the marrow. They must be broken with a bolo.</p>

<p>(6) During the process of boiling the water in which the meat has
been placed must be allowed to run over.</p>

<p>(7) The bones of the game must not be thrown into water. Such an act
would, it is thought, bring sickness on the transgressor or on a member
of his family.</p>

<p>(8) An unmarried man, who has had clandestine relations with a woman,
may not partake of the meat before he has made an expiatory offering to
the owner of the dogs. This offering need not be of any great value and
is usually given in an informal way. The infringement of this taboo is
said to be attended with the same baneful effects on the hunting dogs as
that mentioned above.</p>

<p>(9) For the same reason a married man must make a compensatory
offering of some little thing to his wife in case he has been unfaithful
to her. However, the majority of those whom I questioned knew of no such
counteracting practice.</p></blockquote>

<p>A consideration of the above restrictions will explain the reluctance
that the Manóbo feels in dividing his game with those who are not of his
persuasion. He is afraid that the meat may be cooked in lard or that
some other regulation may be broken, thereby bringing down upon himself
the displeasure of the spirit owner of the game and upon his dogs ill
luck or total lack of success in future hunts.</p>

<p>There are various traditional accounts of people who have been
charmed <sup>37</sup> by deer and never heard of again. It seems that,
at first, they were approached by a circling herd of deer, which they
did not fear and allowed to come close. But among the deer was a
transformed <i>búsau</i> or demon that advanced and devoured the
solitary hunter. It is said that a dog will not follow a deer of this
description.<sup>38</sup></p>

<h5>OTHER METHODS OF OBTAINING GAME</h5>
</center>

<p>The ordinary bow is used but the arrow frequently varies from the
regular fighting arrow in being heavier, thicker, and not provided with
feathering. An arrow with a forked point is occasionally used for small
birds, while for hornbills sharp spikes of <i>palma brava</i> are used
at times to perforate their tough skins. Dart arrows are favorite for
monkeys. The blowpipe (<i>sum-pí-tan</i>)<sup>39</sup> is not used.
Little game is obtained by the bow and arrow, except when the hunter
builds a shelter in a fruit tree and picks off, unseen, such birds as
come to feast themselves.</p>

<p><sup>39</sup>I found a long slender blowpipe all over Mandáyaland
used for shooting birds, but it is not a very successful weapon, nor is
it used in fighting.</p>

<p>&#34;Birdlime,&#34; made out of the viscid sap of certain trees, is
occasionally used to capture small birds.</p>

<h4>TRAPPING</h4>

<a name="2A31"></a>
<h5>TRAPPING CEREMONIES AND TABOOS</h5>
</center>

<p>As on all occasions, the invocation to the turtledove, the
consultation of its cry, and the betel-nut offering to the forest
deities of the locality are performed at the outset by the prospective
trapper. The omission of the last ceremony might expose him to the
danger of being speared by his own trap.</p>

<p>I observed in several districts the use of an ordinary toy
magnet,<sup>40</sup> as a charm <sup>41</sup> to insure success in
trapping, but I suspect that belief in the efficacy of the magnet was
inspired by some inventive trader who wanted to dispose of his magnets
with more dispatch and at a bigger gain. The use, however, of magic
herbs <sup>42</sup> is said to have been learned from the Mamánuas and
is resorted to in the eastern parts of the middle and lower Agúsan. I
was afforded no information either as to the names or the nature of the
herbs used. They are carried around the neck carefully concealed.</p>

<p><sup>40</sup><i>Bá-to báni</i>.</p>

<p><sup>41</sup><i>Súm-pa'</i>.</p>

<p><sup>42</sup><i>Sin-lá-ub</i>.</p>

<p>The male priests and the warrior priests invoke their respective
tutelaries before a trapping expedition and the
<i>manikiad</i><sup>43</sup> calls upon the emissary<sup>44</sup> of the
war deities. The trapper sets a sign
<sup>45</sup>near his house upon his departure. This consists of a bunch
of grass or twigs ti'ed to a stick, and is an intimation to passers-by
of his absence and of the reason for it. He then sets out for his
trapping grounds, but if on the route he meets anyone he must return to
the house at least temporarily,<sup>46</sup> for otherwise he would
catch nothing in the traps.</p>

<p><sup>43</sup>A title conferred upon a man who has one or two deaths
to his credit. The number depends upon the locality.</p>

<p><sup>44</sup>This class of spirits is called <i>pan-aí-yang</i>.</p>

<p><sup>45</sup><i>Ba-li-úg</i>.</p>

<p><sup>46</sup>Manóbos claim that the violation of this taboo would
bring about a condition that is expressed by the word
<i>ma-ka-dú-ya</i>; I can not state definitely what this condition is. I
never have had a satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p>In his absence the following are a few of the taboos that must be
observed:</p>

<p>(1) The trapper's wife must neither do work nor leave the house until
his return, or, in case of protracted absence, until sunset.</p>

<p>(2) No one, not even a dog, may enter the trapper's home unless the
visitor leaves, or unless there is left for him 011 his departure, an
object of personal use, such as his bolo. This is intended as a deposit
and will be returned. The dog must be tied till sunset or a similar
deposit made for it.</p>

<p>(3) The mention of the words pig and deer must be sedulously avoided,
and no one must refer to the purpose of the hunter unless it be in a
periphrastic way.</p>

<p>I observed on several trapping expeditions in which I took part, that
the trapper built a little offering house <sup>47</sup> near his shelter
house, and at first was very regular in his offerings and prayers to the
spirit lord of the forest. His religious fervor, however, decreased in
direct proportion to the bountifulness with which heaven rewarded his
prayers. When he found game becoming scarce, he decided that probably
the local forest spirit was displeased, and tried his luck in other
parts.</p>

<h5>THE BAMBOO SPEAR TRAP <sup>48</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>48</sup><i>Ba-tik</i>.</p>

<p>A common method of trapping among the Manóbos, more especially
practiced during the rainy season, is by the use of the bamboo spear
trap that is in very common use throughout the Philippine Islands.
Without entering into details, it may be described as a trap in which a
spring of bent wood, upon being released, drives a bamboo spear that has
been attached to it into the side of a passing pig or deer. The whole
apparatus is laid horizontally about 1 foot above the ground, and is
carefully concealed. It is a simple contrivance, speedily and cheaply
made, and in the rainy season very successful. Accidents to human beings
from these traps are rare, due to the keen sight and forest instinct
with which the Manóbo is endowed. As the pig or deer passes along the
trail, it releases the spring and is speared in the side. It is seldom
that a wild boar dies on the spot or in the vicinity. It usually has to
be tracked for hours and sometimes is never found.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A33"></a>
<h5>OTHER VARIETIES OF TRAPS</h5>
</center>

<p>Bamboo caltrops are sharp bamboo slats<sup>49</sup> between 2 and 3
feet long set in the ground, usually at an angle of about 45° in places
where the wild boar have to make a descent. It is not a very successful
contrivance, as these animals are endowed with such extraordinary sight
and scent.</p>

<p><sup>49</sup><i>Pa-dúg-pa</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>pa-yu-pa-yu</i> trap consists of a set of bamboo slats as
described above, set on each side of a pig trail, and of a good-sized
log held in a slanting position by a trigger. When released by the boar,
the log falls down behind him, and, by the sudden noise, frightens him
and causes him to jump into the bamboo spikes.</p>

<p>The pitfall<sup>50</sup> is little used. It consists of a hole large
enough for a wild boar or deer, carefully covered so as to deceive the
animal. The bottom bristles with sharp bamboo stakes.</p>

<p><sup>50</sup><i>Tu-kí-bung</i>.</p>

<p>The monkey spring trap<sup>51</sup> is on the style of the bamboo
spear trap described above but is much smaller, being set on the branch
of a tree without any attempt at concealment. The poor, simple-minded
monkey, on catching sight of the bait, walks up innocently, seizes it,
and is wounded by the spear. He does not travel far after that, for
monkeys succumb quickly to a wound.</p>

<p><sup>51</sup><i>Pú-kis</i>.</p>

<p>An ordinary noose trap <sup>52</sup> consists of a string with a
piece of wood bent back and held in position by a trigger. When the
trigger is released, the bent piece of wood draws up the noose tight on
the bird's leg. It is used for catching wild pigeons, jungle fowl, and
other birds.</p>

<p><sup>52</sup><i>Lít'-ag</i>.</p>

<p>The circle of nooses <sup>53</sup> is a series of rattan nooses
placed around a decoy cock. This bird, by his lusty crowing, challenges
his wild fellows to fight. When the fight begins the champion of the
woods soon finds his feet enmeshed in the nooses, and within a short
time his whole body safely lodged in the trapper's carrying basket.</p>

<h4>FISHING</h4>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo fishes more than he hunts, yet he can by no manner of
means be said to be an incessant fisherman. The following are the
methods commonly employed for catching fish.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A41"></a>
<h5>SHOOTING WITH BOW AND ARROW</h5>
</center>

<p>In shooting fish an arrow<sup>54</sup> that has a detachable head is
used. The fisherman conceals himself in a tree or on the bank of a
stream or lake, and upon spying the fish lets fly a two-pronged arrow
which has a steel or iron point.</p>

<p><sup>54</sup><i>Bág'-ai</i>.</p>

<p>This method is in universal use in the lake region of the Agúsan
Valley and in rivers which are too deep for other methods, especially
during floods, when the fish roam around over the inundated land. It is
ordinarily not attended with great success, three or four fish being an
average day's catch. The common catfish, called <i>dalág</i> in Manila,
is the ordinary victim, other species being rare victims to the
arrow.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A42"></a>
<h5>FISHING WITH HOOK AND LINE</h5>
</center>

<p>The hook<sup>55</sup> is a stout one and is made out of the iron
handle of the ordinary kerosene can or out of a piece of brass wire of
similar size. It is attached to a substantial <i>abaká</i>
cord,<sup>56</sup> 45 meters long, more or less. A piece of lead or a
stone for sinker and a suitable bait complete the outfit. The fish
caught with this apparatus are the swordfish<sup>57</sup> and the
sawfish. The fisherman seats himself in his boat or on a sand bank, and
with the line tied to his foot or to his arm awaits a bite. He
immediately pulls in his victim, never giving him a chance to tire
himself out as our fishermen do; Of course the fish is always pulled
upstream.</p>

<a name="2A43"></a>
<h5>FISH POISONING<sup>58</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>58</sup><i>Pag-tu-bá-han</i>.</p>

<p>Poisoning is a common and successful method of fishing, practiced
more frequently on the upper reaches of a river. There are four methods,
all of which I have witnessed frequently throughout Manóboland.</p>

<a name="2A431"></a>
<p><i>The túba<sup>59</sup> method</i>.--A quantity of <i>túba</i>
varying from one-half to two sacksful is put into a dugout and brought
to the spot selected. Everybody comes provided with a fish spear,
fishing bow, bolo, boat or raft, and conical traps<sup>60</sup> made for
the occasion. The <i>túba</i> is then pounded as it lies in the boat, a
little water being added. This process occupies the greater part of an
hour, and is a very animated one, everybody being in high hopes of a
grand feast. Where there are no boats, the <i>túba</i> is pounded in the
rice mortars and brought in bamboo joints to the selected spot.</p>

<p><sup>59</sup><i>Túba</i> is the Croton Tiglium or croton-oil tree.</p>

<p><sup>60</sup><i>Sán-au</i>.</p>

<p>At a point possibly a mile or more down the stream from the place in
which it is decided to cast the poison, the women and girls, aided by a
few men, fix their conical traps across the stream so that no large fish
may escape. When all is ready the <i>túba</i> is thrown into the river,
and everyone dashes downstream with loud exclamations, some in boats,
some on rafts, or; where the water is shallow, wading or jumping from
rock to rock.</p>

<p>It is some 15 minutes before the poison begins to take effect and
then the women and children at the traps may have a busy time removing
the fish in order to keep their traps free for the entrance of more.
During this time the men and boys scurry around jabbing, hitting,
missing, and rushing from side to side with mad shouts of joy and
exultation, sometimes two or three after some fine big dazed fish of
extra size. Thus they may continue for a few hours if the river is a
good sized one and the fish plentiful, for at the beginning a great
number of fish probably dart up side creeks, thus escaping from the
effects of the poison, and when all the fish in the main stream have
fallen a prey, these lurkers must be sought out.</p>

<p><i>Túba</i> has a deleterious effect on man, producing colic and
diarrhea, if taken in fairly strong solution. Yet the fish that die from
the effects of it are perfectly harmless in that respect. The famous
<i>ís-da</i> of the Agúsan Valley is the only fish that does not succumb
to the effects of this poison.</p>

<a name="2A432"></a>
<p>The <i>túbli</i> method.--The root of the <i>túbli</i> plant is used
for poisoning. It is a quicker-acting poison and more universal than the
preceding, in the sense that nothing, not even shellfish, escapes its
baneful effects. As the plant has to be cultivated, it is obvious that
it is not obtainable in large quantities, and for this reason is not
used as a rule on the main streams, the quantity available not being
sufficient to have an effect. It is used in the same manner as
<i>túba</i>.</p>

<a name="2A433"></a>
<p>The <i>lágtañg method</i>.--The <i>lágtañg</i> is the seed of a tree
that is not found in the middle and upper Agúsan Valley. I never
witnessed the use of this poison on a large scale, due undoubtedly to
the absence of it in the middle and upper Agúsan. The following was the
procedure followed in using it as witnessed by me.</p>

<p>A few handfuls of the seeds are toasted in a frying pan and then
pounded in a rice mortar. Then ordinary earthworms, or even the
intestines of a bird, are cut into small bits and mixed with the poison.
A deep quiet pool in a river or a likely place in a lake is selected and
the mixture of worms and <i>lágtañg</i> dropped into the water at the
edge of the pool. In less than five minutes the minnows and small fish
rise to the surface, and begin to circle around giddily. These are
followed by the larger ones but it is not an easy undertaking to catch
them till they have exhausted themselves in their giddy circles or die
in the tall <i>runo</i> grass that grows along the banks.</p>

<p>This poison affects only such fish as eat the worms. People who eat
fish caught in this way seem to suffer no ill effects.</p>

<p>There are other vegetable poisons used in killing fish, but I
remember only the name of the tree called <i>tigaú</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A44"></a>
<h5>DRY SEASON LAKE FISHING<sup>61</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>61</sup><i>Língig</i>.</p>

<p>The mass of lakes and channels in the central Agúsan dries up into
mere pools once a year, or once in a few years, and affords an admirable
opportunity for fishing on a large scale. Thousands of people from as
far south as Lankiláan, and from as far north as Guadalupe, from Los
Arcos on the east and from Walo on the west, troop to the lake region in
their boats. They bring with them their entire families, a supply of
salt, a little rice, if they have it, or the usual substitute (sago and
bananas), their earthen pots and pans, and their bolos. Upon arriving at
a suitable place, they erect a rude shack and start to work. Wading into
the mud and water now half-boiling under a torrid sun, they slash at
every fish that by his hurried dash makes known his presence. After the
fish have been chased in this manner for some time, some of them bury
themselves in the mud, whence they are easily removed with the hand. In
this manner a few men may secure hundreds of fish in a few hours, but
these are only of two species.<sup>62</sup> Other varieties of fish do
not remain in places that dry up to mere ponds. The <i>haú-an</i> are
known to leave the torrid water by wriggling up on land and making their
way to other water. The fish after being caught are taken to the
temporary shack and placed in water<sup>63</sup> until such time as the
owners are ready for the cleaning and salting operations.</p>

<p><sup>62</sup>The <i>ís-da</i> or <i>haú-an</i> and
<i>pu-yo'-pu-yo</i>.</p>

<p><sup>63</sup>It is believed that the flesh of fish will harden if
they are left in water after being caught.</p>

<p>The heads, except such few as are used for the family meals, are
discarded, but the roe and the intestines are carefully preserved as a
delicacy. The body is so cut that it can be spread out into one thin
piece and then salted, usually in a rather stingy way, about 3.5 liters
of salt being used for as many as 90 fish. The fish are then set up on
an elevated bamboo frame and left to dry for a whole day or more,
according to the strength of the sun.</p>

<p>Though the fishing season is one of the merriest of the year, yet it
is a time of work and of stench. It is no unusual thing for the whole
family to work till the late hours of the night in order to prevent the
fish from putrefying. The odor that prevails where thousands of fish
heads--that have not been consumed by the crocodiles that infest the
main channels--are rotting under a blazing sun is left to the reader's
imagination. The season may last as much as one month and one family may
have thousands of dried fish.<sup>64</sup> Ordinarily the lack of salt
makes it impossible for any of the Manóbos, except those of the better
class, to remain long, unless they choose to work for the Bisáyas.</p>

<p><sup>64</sup><i>Dá-ing</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="2A45"></a>
<h5>FISHING WITH NETS, TRAPS, AND TORCHES</h5>
</center>

<p>Fishing with nets is not practiced except by a few Manóbos on the
seacoast or by the Christianized Manóbos who have learned the practice
from Bisáyas, though I have seen cast nets used on the upper Tágo, upper
Simúlao, and upper Agúsan.</p>

<p>The <i>búbo</i> is a cigar-shaped trap made of slats of rattan, from
0.5 to 1 meter in length. The swifter the current, the smaller the trap
used. The large end has a cone with its apex pointing inward. It is made
of bamboo slats which are left unfastened at the apex of the cone so
that the fish may enter but not get out. This trap is set with its mouth
facing either up or down stream.</p>

<p>Another form of this trap<sup>65</sup> is cylindrical and not conical
like the <i>búbo</i>. It is set in swamps with an evil-smelling bait and
quickly becomes filled with a very savory mudfish.<sup>66</sup></p>

<p><sup>65</sup><i>Bág-yas</i>.</p>

<p><sup>66</sup><i>Pán-tat</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>hí-pon</i>, <i>u-yáp</i>, and <i>u-yáp tá-na</i> are varieties
of small fish that at fixed intervals make their way up the Agúsan to a
distance of from 20 to 30 miles in innumerable quantities. It is said
that they arrive at the expected date and hour. They are scooped into
dugouts with scoop nets in immense quantities and salted for sale. This
method of fishing is confined practically to Bisáyas, but a goodly
number of Christianized Manóbos who live in the vicinity of Butuán take
part in it.</p>

<p>A fairly common method of fishing among the Christianized Manóbos, as
also among the pagan Manóbos who do not live in too warlike a country,
is by the use of a spear and torch. Going along the banks of the stream,
the fisherman lures the fish with the light and secures them with a jab
of his three-pronged spear. In this way he may secure enough for a meal
or two. Where the water is deep enough, this method of fishing is
attended with great danger from crocodiles, especially in the lake
region where they abound in numbers beyond conception.</p>

<h3>WEAPONS AND IMPLEMENTS</h3>

<a name="2B1"></a>
<h4>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS</h4>
</center>

<p>There is no knowledge of a former use of stone implements in
Manóboland. During my peregrinations throughout eastern Mindanáo I saw
no stone implements except the ordinary whetstone, so universally used
for sharpening steel weapons and knives, the cooking stones upon which
the pots are placed, and the flint used in the production of fire. It is
true that there is a common rumor as to the existence of stone missiles
hurled in wrath by Anítan<sup>1</sup> at irreverent mortals, but I have
never seen these tokens of divine anger.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B2"></a>
<h4>OFFENSIVE WEAPONS</h4>

<a name="2B21"></a>
<h5>THE BOW AND ARROW</h5>
</center>

<p>As the use of the bow and arrow in the Philippines is generally
considered by ethnologists to indicate Negrito influence, the subject
requires more than passing notice, especially as the geographical
distribution of this primitive weapon extends to not only every
non-Christian tribe and group east of the central Cordillera of
Mindanáo, except perhaps the Banuáons,<sup>2</sup> but, according to
various rumors, to the Manóbos occupying the central portion of Mindanáo
in the subprovince of Bukídnon.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>I am very much inclined to think that it exists among
them as well.</p>

<p>The bow is a piece of <i>palma brava</i>,<sup>3</sup> or less
frequently of bamboo<sup>4</sup> varying in length between 1.2 and 2
meters and in thickness between 7 and 12 millimeters. In the center it
is about 30 millimeters broad and gradually tapers to a breadth of about
12 millimeters at each end. Except on the upper Agúsan<sup>5</sup> no
means are taken to strengthen this stock by winding rattan around it,
unless the bamboo or wood shows indications of splitting, in which case
a girdle of plaited rattan obviates the danger. No attempt at
ornamentation is made except the smoothing and polishing of the wood. In
the case of bamboo stocks, the projecting pieces of the joints are not
removed on the proximal side of the bow. At about 2 or 3 centimeters
from the extremities, two notches are made to hold the string. At the
extremity, which we will call the upper one, from its being held up
during use, one often sees a few concentric incised circles in one of
which is set a little ring of steel, iron, or brass wire. The object of
this is to increase the twang of the bow upon the release of the
arrow.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>An-á-hau</i>.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>Of the species called <i>pa-túng</i>.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>Mandáya and Mañgguáñgan bows are smaller and neater than
Manóbo bows. They are made commonly of a piece of betel-nut palm and
have graceful lashings of rattan strips on the stock for the purpose of
imparting strength thereto.</p>

<p>The bowstring is nearly always a strip of rattan about 3 millimeters
broad. This is attached to the lower end of the stock by a simple series
of loops. To the upper extremity it is attached by a loop that slips
along the stock into the upper notch when the bow is strung for
shooting. It is needless to remark that the bowstring is about 2 or 3
centimeters shorter than the stock, which in the moment of stringing
must be bent to enable the upper extremity of the string to reach the
upper notch and thereby acquire a sufficient tension to propel the
arrow.</p>

<p>Arrows are of several kinds according to the purpose for which they
are used, such as hunting, fishing, and fighting. Those intended for
hunting and fishing will be described in their proper places. The
following description applies exclusively to the offensive arrow used in
fighting.</p>

<p>The shaft of this arrow consists of a reed of bamboo<sup>6</sup>
about 8 millimeters in diameter and somewhat over a meter long, with a
bamboo head. The head is a sliver of bamboo<sup>7</sup> varying in
length from 20 to 36 centimeters. On the upper Agúsan, where the Manóbos
seem to have assimilated much from the Mandáyas, both the head and the
shaft of the arrow are much shorter, much neater, and, in general, much
handier. The arrowhead is broadest at about two-thirds of its distance
from the point. From this broad part, or shoulder, as we might call it,
the head tapers to a sharp point at one end and to such a size at the
other that it can be inserted into the natural socket of the shaft. In
this socket it is retained by a lashing of fine rattan, which serves at
once to retain it in place and to prevent the frail bamboo shaft from
splitting. A coating of <i>tabon-tábon</i><sup>8</sup> seed pulp over
the lashing prevents it from loosening or slipping and at the same time
preserves it from atmospheric action. Occasionally one sees arrowheads
with square shoulders that act as barbs. I have never seen steel
arrowheads in use among Manóbos, though it is certain that they are used
by Mañgguáñgans between the Agúsan and the Sálug.<sup>9</sup> It is not
unlikely, moreover, that they are used by the people of the Ihawán and
Baóbo Rivers.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>Of the species known as <i>la-hí'</i>.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>Da-mu-án</i> species.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Parinarium mindanaense</i> (<i>Rosaceae</i>).</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>I purchased for the Bureau of Science Museum a unique
specimen which, besides having a steel head, is provided with an ugly
spur. The owner claimed that it was one of the arrows that had been shot
at him and the party that accompanied him by the people of a Mañgguáñgan
settlement. I was one of his party.</p>

<p>A very important feature from an ethnological standpoint is the
feathering of the arrow. The object of this is to steady the arrow in
its flight and thereby prevent windage. The method of feathering is as
follows: The quills of the wing feathers of a hornbill, or sometimes of
a fish eagle, are parted down the middle. Then three, or sometimes only
two, of these parted quills with their adhering vanes are placed
longitudinally at equal distances along the arrow shaft so that their
extremities are about 6 centimeters from the butt of the shaft and their
webs stand straight out from the surface of the reed, forming equal
obtuse angles to one another. These vanes are retained in this position
by windings of very light, flexible rattan at their extremities. As a
security against slipping or change of relative position, a coating of
the above-mentioned fruit pulp, often mixed with pot black, is applied.
The final preparation of the arrow consists in chopping off with a bolo
or small knife the outer edges of the vanes. This is done in a slightly
slanting direction within about 1 centimeter of the butt end of the
vanes, at which point they are cut in a direction transverse to the
length of the arrow shaft.</p>

<p>The feathering of the arrow is always done with precision, as the
accuracy of its flight, the uniformity of its rotation, the length of
its trajectory, and the consequent penetrative power are known to depend
upon proper care in this respect.</p>

<p>Unlike other bowmen, the Manóbo makes a notch in the butt end of his
arrow, but as far as my observations go, there are never any decorative
incisions and tracings on Manóbo arrows.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p><sup>10</sup>Among the Mandáyas arrow shafts frequently have
ornamental wavy lines and concentric circles incised along the length of
the shaft, but this decoration has been observed among no other tribe
that I know of in eastern Mindanáo.</p>

<p>There seem to be no special arrow makers. Nearly every adult Manóbo,
who has not relinquished the use of the bow and arrow, with no other
tool than his bolo and perhaps a small knife, can complete a bow and a
bunch of arrows in a relatively short time.</p>

<p>In stringing the bow it is grasped by the center of the stock with
the left hand and the top, where the loose loop of the bowstring is
placed, is held with the right hand. The bottom of the bow rests upon
the ground and is supported by the right foot. The right hand then, by a
movement toward the person, bends the stock sufficiently to allow the
loop of the bowstring to reach and slip into its notch, the left hand
and foot retaining the bow in a bent position. The bowman then grasps
the central part of the stock between the thumb and the four fingers of
the left hand and seizing the feathered part of the arrow between the
first and middle fingers of the right, he places the end of it at right
angles to, and in contact with, the center, or thereabouts, of the
string. The part of the arrow in front of the feathering rests upon the
thumb and middle finger and under the index finger of the left hand.
Raising up the bow and holding it inclined at an angle of about 20° from
the vertical, the top being toward the right, the string, with the arrow
butt always pressed against it, is drawn back sufficiently (about 30
centimeters) to give the requisite tension. The string is then allowed
to fly back, while at the same time the bowman releases his hold upon
the arrow butt, and thus the arrow speeds on its way. When ready to be
released the end of the arrow points to the bowman's right shoulder.</p>

<p>The greatest range of a good arrow is about 75 meters. Its effective
range, however, is only about one-third of that.</p>

<p>I can not laud the expertness of the Manóbo as a bowman. Here and
there one meets a really good shot, but the average man can not score 50
per cent at close range.</p>

<p>No quivers worthy of the name are used. When a war raid is
undertaken, the arrows are placed in a bamboo internode, which is
carried in a horizontal position at the bowman's side. Arrows are never
poisoned. The bamboo of which the spearhead is made seems to have a
somewhat poisonous effect as a wound caused by it is very painful and
hard to cure.</p>

<a name="2B22"></a>
<h5>THE BOLO AND ITS SHEATH</h5>
</center>

<p>The next important offensive weapon used by the Manóbo is the bolo.
It is his inseparable companion by day and, in regions where the
influence of civil or military authority is not strongly felt, also by
night.</p>

<p>As there are but two Manóbo blacksmiths that I know of, all bolos
used are imported, either from the Mandáyas or from the Banuáons, though
one sees from time to time a weapon that has made its way from the
Bagóbos. The prevailing bolo is of Mandáya workmanship and merits a more
detailed description.</p>

<p>It is a substantial steel blade varying in length from 30 to 45
centimeters. At its juncture with the handle it is about as broad as the
handle but narrows gradually on top, and less so on the lower edge, to a
breadth of 25 millimeters<sup>11</sup> at a point one-sixth of the
length of the blade from the handle. At this point the back of the bolo
changes its direction, running off at an angle to its previous direction
of 15°. The lower part or edge of the weapon gradually bellies out until
the blade, at a point one-fourth of its entire length from the tip
attains its maximum breadth (7 to 10 centimeters) whence it curves like
the segment of a circle to the point of the weapon.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>Figures given are approximate only. They vary in
different bolos.</p>

<p>The type of bolo that is considered more pretentious, and that is
more common on the upper Agúsan, has a thin straight back<sup>12</sup>
up to within 6 or 7 centimeters from the handle, at which point the
direction of the back is slightly changed. In other respects this bolo
is similar to the one described above.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>Hence it is called <i>li-kúd-li-kud</i>.</p>

<p>At the narrowest part of the bolo and on the underside there is
occasionally a serrated decoration in the steel, the significance of
which I do not know.</p>

<p>The handle is occasionally of ebony, but more commonly of some other
wood. The grasp for the hand is cylindrical. The handle is often bound
with a braid of rattan, or a band or two of steel or of brass, to
prevent splitting, or less commonly with silver bands for ornament's
sake. Curving downward beyond the grasp is a carved ornamentation that
suggests remotely the head of a bird with an upturned curving bill. This
is one continuous piece with the grasp. It is rare to find brass
ferrules and hand guards at the juncture of the blade with the
handle.</p>

<p>The sheath, which is of Manóbo production, consists of two pieces of
thin light wood a little broader than the bolo. It is almost rectangular
in form for a distance equal to the length of the blade, and then the
edges become gradually narrower up to a point that is about 3
centimeters from the end; at this point they expand into a small square
with incurving sides.</p>

<p>The two pieces are held together closely by bands of rattan coiled
around them at equal intervals. A coating of beeswax serves to preserve
the wood and at the same time to impart a finished appearance to the
sheath. Frequently pot black is mixed with the beeswax, and on the upper
and central parts, and on the ends and edges, symmetrical bands of this
black paint are applied according to the fancy of the wearer. Other
decorations of beads, cotton tassels, and strips of a yellow parasitic
plant, are not at all infrequent.</p>

<p>The girdle, which is nearly always of braided <i>abaká</i> fiber,
frequently multicolored, and which holds the weapon to the left side of
the wearer, passes through a hole on the outer side of the sheath. This
hole is made through the central embossed part of the outer piece of
the sheath.</p>

<p>A noteworthy feature of the sheath is that it is so made that by
pushing the handle to the lower side of the aperture of the sheath, the
weapon remains locked and can not fall out or be withdrawn until the
handle is pushed back to the upper side of the aperture.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B23"></a>
<h5>A MAGIC TEST FOR THE EFFICIENCY OF A BOLO</h5>
</center>

<p>It is very interesting to observe the method pursued in determining
the value of the bolo. A piece of rattan the length of the weapon is cut
into small pieces, each one, excepting perhaps the last, exactly as long
as the maximum width of the bolo. These pieces are then placed in the
following positions and in the order indicated by the number. (See fig.
1.) It is obvious that, as a rule, there is one piece of rattan that is
not as long as the others. This piece is always set down last, and its
position is the determining factor of the test.</p>

<a name="F1"></a>
<img src="IMAGES/FIGURE01.JPG" alt="FIGURE 1">

<p>In Figure 1 <i>a</i> all the pieces of rattan happen to be equal,
there being no short piece. Moreover, there are enough pieces to
complete the figure. This combination is not inauspicious in so far as
it does not augur evil, but it is thought to be a sure indication of a
failure to kill.<sup>13</sup></p>

<p><sup>13</sup>This combination is called <i>lí-mut</i>.</p>

<p>In Figure 1 <i>b</i> all the pieces are of equal length, but there
are not enough to complete the figure as in figure 1 <i>a</i>. This is a
doubtful con-figuration. On the one hand the weapon may or may not kill,
on the other it will prove efficient to the owner in matters not
connected with fighting.</p>

<p>In Figure 1 <i>c</i> we have only four pieces of rattan, three of
which are equal to the maximum width of the bolo and one of which is
short. This is a good combination. It indicates that in a fight the
enemy will suffer loss.<sup>14</sup></p>

<p><sup>14</sup>This formation is called <i>sá-kab</i>.</p>

<p>In Figure 1 <i>d</i> we have the best conformation possible. The fact
that the short section falls, as it were, inside, indicates that a short
fight and speedy death may be expected. The owner of a weapon that
passes this test is reluctant to part with it unless very advantageous
offers are made to him.</p>

<p>A form of divination in which a suspended bolo, especially a
consecrated one, takes the part of the <i>deus ex machina</i> is
described in the chapter on divination.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B24"></a>
<h5>THE LANCE</h5>
</center>

<p>The lance, like the bolo, is imported. It is of two kinds: (1) The
Mandáya lance, which is found everywhere except on the lower Agúsan and
on the upper reaches of the Umaíam, Argáwan, and Kasilaían, and in the
eastern Cordillera; (2) a lance, probably of Moro production, which is
said to come from the Pulángi River, and which is used in the regions
just mentioned where the Mandáya lance is not considered lucky or
effective. In general, lances consist of a steel head and a long shaft,
usually of <i>palma brava</i>, but rarely of some other
species.<sup>15</sup> The head is firmly attached to the shaft with a
viscous substance.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>Wood of the tree <i>ku-li-pá-pa</i> is used
occasionally.</p>

<p>The lance is the inseparable companion of the Manóbo in his travels
through dangerous places, of which there are not a few in remote
regions. When he arrives at a house he sticks the lance in the ground,
head up, near the ladder. In traveling he carries it upon his right
shoulder, head forward, in a horizontal position and is ever ready to
throw it if he fears an ambush. I have frequently startled my Manóbo
friends while they were engaged in some occupation, such as fishing,
just to study their demeanor. The result was always the same--a quick
turn and an attitude of offense, with lance poised and defiant eye.</p>

<p>The lance is held during the poise in the upturned right hand under
the thumb and over the first and second fingers. The arm is extended in
a slight curve just in front of the line of the shoulders. In making a
thrust, the lance is darted parallel to the line of the shoulders and on
a level with them, the left side of the person being presented to the
adversary. The lance is not thrown, but is nearly always retained in the
hand.</p>

<p>The Mandáya lance merits most attention, as it is more generally
used, and is usually of better mechanical and ornamental workmanship.
The shaft is a piece of either <i>palma brava</i> or of <i>kulipápa</i>
palm, varying from 1.8 to 2.4 meters in length. It has a uniform
diameter of about 16 millimeters for a distance equal to one-half of its
length from, the head; the other half tapers very gradually to about
one-half of its original thickness, ending in a fairly sharp point,
which may be capped with a conical piece of tin or of steel to protect
the wood against injury from stones.</p>

<p>The head is a long, slender, pointed blade. From the shoulders, which
are from 4 to 7 centimeters apart, it may taper uniformly to a point;
much more commonly, however, it tapers gradually to within about 25
millimeters of the extremity. Here its width is about 25 millimeters. At
this point the edges converge at an angle of 45° to the axis, until they
meet, forming the point of the lance. From the shoulders of the blade
the edges likewise slant inward to the neck at an angle of 45°. The neck
is a solid cylindrical piece, about 3 centimeters in length, nearly
always ornamented with embossed work, and ends in a rod or in a conical
socket about 7 centimeters long. It is very common to see ornamental
chisel work along the axis near the neck. The general outline of the
engraving is that of the spearhead in miniature, within which there are
often little leaflike puncturings.</p>

<p>When the lance head has a socket it is attached to the shaft with a
resinous substance similar to that used for bolos. When the lance head
ends in a solid cylindrical piece and must be inserted in the hollow
shaft, the end of the shaft is reinforced with a Moro brass ferrule, if
the possessor of the lance has been so lucky as to have acquired one, or
with coils of <i>abaká</i> fiber over which has been wound <i>abaká</i>
cloth stuck with the above mentioned resin.</p>

<p>Lances of the better style have ornamental rings of beaten silver,
sometimes amounting to as many as 15, placed at equal distances along
the shaft for a distance of as much as 30 centimeters from the juncture
of the head and the shaft.</p>

<p>A lance of another style is common among the highland Manóbos of the
central Cordillera, and is not infrequently found among the Manóbos of
Kantílan and Tágo. Though not so striking in dimensions and in general
appearance, it is preferred by the Manóbo, because it is said to cause a
more severe wound and because it is less liable to have the head
detached when driven through the floor or wall of a house. Its head is
much narrower at its broadest part than the one just described, is not
so long, and nearly always tapers to a point. It is without any
shoulders. It never has the conical steel socket that the Mandáya lance
sometimes has, is always straight edged, and is set into the shaft in
identically the same manner as the socketless Mandáya weapon. Another
point of distinction is the decorative scallop that runs parallel to the
edges of the head on each side. There is very seldom any decorative work
within the periphery of these scallops.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B25"></a>
<h5>THE DAGGER AND ITS SHEATH</h5>
</center>

<p>A weapon, whose distribution among Manóbos is limited almost
exclusively to Manóbos south of the 8° of latitude, is the Mandáya
dagger, of Mandáya workmanship, and indicative of Mandáya
influence.<sup>16</sup></p>

<p><sup>16</sup>It is the Mandáya tribal weapon that never leaves its
wearer's side by night or by day, on the trail or in the house, whenever
there is apprehension of danger.</p>

<p>Its component parts are a thin laminated piece of steel from 15 to 25
centimeters long with a thin, tapering rod somewhat shorter, projecting
in the line of the axis, and a hilt of <i>banáti</i> through which the
projection of the blade passes. It is carried in a sheath which is held
at the wearer's right side by a girdle.</p>

<p>The blade is two-edged, widening from a sharp point to two shoulders
from 3 to 4 centimeters apart, whence the edges incurve gradually and
finally end in two projecting spurs 3 or 4 centimeters apart. The rod
for the reception of the hilt extends from this point along the line of
the axis for a distance of from 6 to 8 centimeters.</p>

<p>From time to time one finds a blade that is inlaid with tiny pieces
of brass or silver, but there is never any other kind of
ornamentation.</p>

<p>The handle is of a type that is unique, as far as I know, in the
Philippine Islands. In using the dagger the body of the hilt is seized
in the right hand, the index finger is inserted between one horn of the
crescent and the central steel tang, and the thumb between the latter
and the other point of the crescent, while the other three fingers hold
the weapon within the palm. This method seems clumsy, but nevertheless
it is the orthodox way of holding it. Fastened to the right side of the
wearer in a more or less horizontal position and with the handle
projecting forward, it is always at the owner's disposal for prompt and
deadly action, especially so as only a mere thread or two of
<i>abaká</i> fiber running from the handle to the under part of the
sheath retains the weapon in its sheath.</p>

<p>The handle is usually strengthened at the neck with plaited rings of
<i>nito</i> fiber and may have ornamental silver work, both at that
point and on the horns, or even at times on the whole outer surface of
it.</p>

<p>The sheath consists of two pieces of wood of an elongated rectangular
shape, spreading out at the extremity. Strips of rattan wound at
intervals hold the two pieces together and a paint of blended beeswax
and pot black is ordinarily employed to give a finish to it. But
occasionally one sees bands of beaten silver at the head of the sheath,
and, less frequently, a profusion of beautiful, artistic silverwork set
over the whole sheath.<sup>17</sup></p>

<p><sup>17</sup>The steelwork and silverwork are nearly always the
production of Mandáya smiths living in and beyond the southeastern
Cordillera, though on the Agúsan there are a few silversmiths.</p>

<p>Manóbos in general, with the exception of those who live on the upper
Agúsan, take but little care of their weapons, except to sharpen them.
In this respect they are very unlike the Mandáyas and the Debabáons, who
are most conscientious and incessant in the care of their bolos, lances,
and daggers. They keep these weapons burnished by rubbing them on a
board that has been covered with the dust from a pulverized plate, or if
they have rusted, by filing them with an imported file. A final touch is
given to them by rubbing them with the leaves of what we might call the
sandpaper plant.<sup>18</sup> Once burnished they are protected from
rust by applications of hog fat, a little piece of which is suspended
from the roof whenever a pig is killed. Another point of difference
between the Manóbos, not including those of the upper Agúsan, and the
above-mentioned peoples is the infrequency with which the former make
use of racks for their fighting weapons. The Mandáyas and the Debabáons
very commonly have ornamental racks in which they keep their weapons.</p>

<h4>DEFENSIVE WEAPONS</h4>

<a name="2B31"></a>
<h5>THE SHIELD</h5>
</center>

<p>Two varieties of shield are in use, the Mandáya and the Manóbo. The
diffusion of the former is limited to the district south of the 8°
latitude, not including the Ihawán and Baóbo River district; the latter,
to the rest of the Agúsan Valley with the exception of the portion where
Banuáon influence is prevalent,<sup>19</sup> such as the upper Agúsan
and rivers to the north of it, which are the western tributaries of the
Agúsan. In general, shields are made of <i>kalántas</i><sup>20</sup>
wood, varying from 90 to 100 centimeters in length. In the center is a
projecting knob resembling a low truncated cone about 4 centimeters high
and varying in width at the base from 8 to 15 centimeters, and at the
truncation from 7 to 8.5 centimeters. The inside of this knob is
hollowed out in such a way that a longitudinal piece is left on the
inside of it for holding the shield. The upper end has a transverse
piece of the same material as the rest of the shield dovetailed into the
main body, the object being to prevent the body of the shield, whose
grain runs longitudinally, from splitting as a result of a blow.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>The Banuáon types of shield seen by the writer were
circular in form, concave on the proximal side, and made of plaited
rattan painted with <i>tabon-tábon</i> pulp.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup><i>La-níp-ga</i>.</p>

<p>As a further protection against splitting, two strips of <i>palma
brava</i> or of bamboo in upper Agúsan types, and in other types three
strips as wide as the shield itself are set horizontally on each side,
facing each other, and are held in position by sewings of rattan slips
passing through perforations in the wood.</p>

<p>The ornamentation of all shields consists of a coating of beeswax,
and of thin scallops painted with beeswax and pot black, passing in a
single series around the shield and near its edge, and in a double
series longitudinally down the center.</p>

<p>The operculum,<sup>21</sup> of a seashell, or very occasionally some
bright object, may set off the knob. Not infrequently tufts of human
hair secured in some war raid are stuck into holes at distances of about
3 centimeters on both sides of the shield, and are considered highly
ornamental and indicative of the valor of the owner of the shield. One
might be inclined to think that the employment of human hair is a relic
of head-hunting, but I was unable to find a single tradition of its
practice in eastern Mindanáo and I doubt if such ever existed.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>Called <i>pas-lí-tan</i>.</p>

<p>The typical Manóbo shield has a straight top about 35 centimeters
broad. From the corners the sides gradually curve inward for a distance
(measured upon the central longitudinal line of the shield) of about 25
centimeters, at which point they curve out to the original width at a
distance of about 10 centimeters farther on, where the strengthening
strips are fastened on both the inner and outer surfaces. Thence the
sides curve in to form the second segment, in the center of which is
situated the knob, and at the end of which are placed two more
sustaining crosspieces. Beyond this section, the sides gently curve to
the bottom of the shield, which is about 25 centimeters broad and
practically straight.</p>

<p>The Mandáya type, as adopted from the Mandáyas by the Agusánon
Manóbos<sup>22</sup> differs from the Manóbo shield in being generally
narrower--about 17 centimeters at the top and about 22 centimeters in
the central section. From the top, where the transverse protective piece
is placed the sides slope out gently to the first sustaining crosspiece
placed at a distance from the end of about one-fourth of the entire
length of the shield; thence they run parallel for a distance equal to
one-half of the shield length, forming to the eye an elongated
rectangle, in the center of which is the knob. The remaining quarter of
the shield is hyperbolic in form with a small lozenge-shaped protrusion
at the focus. The upper edge of the shield is not quite straight, an
ornamental effect being produced by slight curves. In the center of the
upper edge is a very small projection or sometimes a round incision,
that might serve as an eyehole.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>Also by the Mañgguáñgans and by the Debabáon and Mansáka
groups. The Manóbos and other peoples of the upper Agúsan call
themselves Agusánon.</p>

<p>Another difference in this type of shield is the addition of
ornamental toothlike tracings. These serrations are done with beeswax
and pot black, and are ordinarily set in groups of four at right angles
to and along the central and the lateral scallops.</p>

<p>The last distinction is the more noticeable longitudinal bend which
the Mandáya type has as compared with the Manóbo style, the top and the
bottom being inflected uniformly inward at an angle of about 15° to the
vertical.</p>

<p>Among the Mandáyas it is interesting to note that a broad shield is
looked down upon as indicative of cowardice, and that a narrow shield is
considered evidence of valor in its owner.</p>

<p>In using the shield it is held in the left hand by the grasp that is
located in the inner part of the hollow knob in the center. It is always
held in an upright position, the transverse piece being on top, at the
left side of the warrior, who never presents the front of his person to
the enemy. To protect the feet and legs he must crouch down.</p>

<p>I was a constant witness of mimic encounters, and occasionally of
what appeared to be the preliminaries to more serious affairs, and can
bear witness to the skill displayed in the manipulation of the shield.
The rapidity with which the warrior can move about, now advancing, now
retreating, now thrusting, now parrying, and all the time concealing the
whole of his person except a part of the head and one eye, is a
marvel.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B32"></a>
<h5>ARMOR</h5>
</center>

<p>Another article used for defensive purposes is the <i>abaká</i>
armor.<sup>23</sup> Whenever the warrior has been able to procure a
piece of Mandáya skirt fabric, he sews it into an ordinary coat with
sleeves and, in lieu of imported buttons, uses little slivers of bamboo
or wood to keep it closed. When, however, the Mandáya cloth is not to be
had, his female relatives braid for him a number of multicolored cords
of <i>abaká</i> fiber, 6 millimeters broad, which are sewn together in
the form of an American or European coat and answer the purpose perhaps
better than the Mandáya cloth.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup><i>Lim botung</i>.</p>

<p>This armor is intended to resist arrows, and is said to be efficient
when the wearer is at long range. At short range, however, it helps only
to lessen the penetration, as I had occasion to observe after an attack
on the upper Agúsan, in which one of my warrior friends was wounded on
the shoulder by an arrow. A band of Debabáons went to make a
demonstration at the house of one of their enemies on the River Nábuk.
The particular warrior chief referred to, desiring to initiate his young
son into the art of warfare, carried him on his back to the scene of the
demonstration. After surrounding the house, the attacking party broke
out into the war cry and challenged their foes to a hand-to-hand combat.
The surrounded party replied with a shower of arrows, one of which
struck the chief on the shoulder. As he explained to me, he was so
solicitous about guarding his child that he exposed his person and
received the arrow in his shoulder. The point, he said penetrated to a
depth of about 3 centimeters.</p>

<p>I once saw another form of protective clothing on the River Argáwan.
It was a very long strip of cotton cloth which, it was said, was used
for wrapping around and around the body before an attack. This article,
as I later ascertained, was of Banuáon manufacture and
use.<sup>24</sup></p>

<p><sup>24</sup>As a further protection in war there is used, it is
said, a conical piece of wood on which the hair is bound up. I never saw
this device in use and doubt if it is employed commonly by Manóbos. It
was reported to me as also being of Banuáon origin and make. </p>

<center>
<a name="2B33"></a>
<h5>TRAPS AND CALTROPS</h5>
</center>

<p>The dwellings of Manóbos who live in actual fear of attack are always
surrounded by traps and by bamboo caltrops of one or two varieties.
These form an efficient and common means of defense.</p>

<p>The trap is of the type described in the chapter on hunting. When
this trap is used as a means of defense, the spear is set at such a
height that it will wound a human being between the shoulders and the
thigh. The traps are set in varying numbers in the immediate vicinity of
the house, though if an attack is considered imminent they are set on
the trails leading to the house and some distance away. They may be so
set that they will not strike the one who releases them but the first or
second person following him. It is always prudent for a white man in a
hostile country to so safeguard himself and his men that no one will be
injured by these traps.</p>

<p>The bamboo caltrops referred to are slivers of sharpened bamboo,
about 60 centimeters long, set in the ground at an angle of 45°, and at
some point where the enemy has to descend to a lower level. A favorite
spot is behind a log or at the descent to a stream. They are carefully
concealed and, to a white man not aware of the use of such traps, a
dangerous device.</p>

<p>Another form of caltrops very common indeed, and very treacherous in
its character, consists of small spikes made of slivers of bamboo, about
18 centimeters long, or of pointed pieces of hardwood. These are set in
goodly numbers in the trails that lead from the adjoining forest to the
house. The peculiar danger of these is that they protrude only about 2
or 3 centimeters above the ground, the soil being loosened around them
so that the pressure of the wayfarer's foot presses down the loose soil,
thereby giving the treacherous spike an opportunity to pierce the foot
to a considerable depth.</p>

<h4>AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS</h4>
</center>

<p>Implements of husbandry are few and far between. As there are no
draft animals in Manóboland, no plows, harrows, or other implements
which require animals are made use of.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B41"></a>
<h5>THE AX</h5>
</center>

<p>For felling the larger trees a simple steel ax is used. It is set in
a hole in a hardwood handle, usually of guava wood, and is retained in
place by a couple of plaits of rattan. The edge of the ax is only 6 or 7
centimeters long and yet it is surprising what the average Manóbo man
can accomplish with this insignificant-looking implement. Mounted upon
his frail scaffold he attacks the mighty trees of his forest home and
with unerring blow brings them down in a surprisingly short time.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B42"></a>
<h5>THE BOLO</h5>
</center>

<p>For cutting off the branches, the bolo, which may be at the same time
his weapon for attack or defense, is used. The work bolo is in no wise
distinguished from the fighting weapon except that the former has a
broad straight back. It is more usual to find a bolo of Bisáya
manufacture in use by Manóbos of the lower Agúsan. These bolos come from
Bohol or from Cebu and, being comparatively cheap and answering the
purpose equally well, are readily purchased.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B43"></a>
<h5>THE RICE HEADER</h5>
</center>

<p>During the harvest time the rice heads are cut with a header made of
a small piece of rattan or wood about 1.5 centimeters in diameter and
between 4 and 6 centimeters long. In the center of this and at right
angles to it is lashed a piece of tin or one of the valves of a common
shellfish.<sup>25</sup></p>

<h4>FISHING IMPLEMENTS</h4>

<a name="2B51"></a>
<h5>THE FISHING BOW AND ARROW</h5>
</center>

<p>The bow and arrow are used for fishing, wherever the Agúsan peoples,
Christian and non-Christian, have access to the lakes and pools that
abound in the central Agúsan.</p>

<p>The bow used in fishing and its accessories in nowise differs from
the more serious article intended for warfare, except that, due to its
more frequent use, it may be more dilapidated in appearance.</p>

<p>Fishing arrows, however, are different from those used in fighting.
The shaft of the former is a piece of bamboo,<sup>26</sup> varying in
length from 1.2 to 1.5 meters and in maximum diameter from 7 to 12.5
millimeters.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup>Of the variety called <i>lá-hi</i> or
<i>da-ga-sá'</i>.</p>

<p>The head is a 2-pronged piece of iron or steel about 17 centimeters
long, with barbs on the inner side of each prong, equidistant from the
extremity and facing each other. These two prongs unite to form a solid
neck that runs into the natural hole in the shaft, a ferrule of brass,
or more frequently a winding of rattan coated with <i>tabon-tábon</i>
seed pulp, serving to prevent the splitting of the frail bamboo tube.
The head is attached to the shaft by a substantial string of
<i>abaká</i> fiber, about 1.5 meters long, which is wound about the
shaft, but which is unwound by the fish in its frantic efforts to
escape, leaving him with the arrowhead in his body, and with the shaft
breaking the water and indicating to the fisherman the whereabouts of
his victim. On the far upper Agúsan the arrowhead is not of the
2-pronged type but is a thin, laminated steel point that expands
gradually to form the two lateral barbs. It is of Mandáya manufacture
and origin.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B52"></a>
<h5>THE FISH SPEAR</h5>
</center>

<p>The fish spear,<sup>27</sup> except on the far upper Agúsan, consists
of a long bamboo shaft from 1.5 to 2.25 meters in length with a heavy
3-pronged barbed head set into a node at its larger end and with
strengthening girdles of rattan strips serving to reinforce it. The iron
head is of Bisáya or of Christian Manóbo workmanship. On the upper
Agúsan the head is 2-pronged and the shaft is frequently somewhat longer
than that of the spear used on the lower river. In other respects it is
identical.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup><i>Sá-pang</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B53"></a>
<h5>FISHHOOKS</h5>
</center>

<p>Large hooks are much more commonly used than small ones. Both are
made out of either brass wire or of iron, the latter often from the
handle of a kerosene can, and in general they resemble ordinary
fishhooks such as are made in civilized countries. The method of using
the hook has been described already under &#34;Fishing.&#34;</p>

<p>For crocodiles a peculiar hook is used. It consists of a piece of
<i>palma brava</i>, sharpened at one end, and provided with a spur
projecting backward at an angle of about 30°. To this piece of wood is
attached a stout rope of <i>abaká</i> fiber, which in its turn is tied
to a piece of stout bamboo about 1.8 meters long. The bamboo is then set
firmly in the ground, and the bait is allowed to hang within about 60
centimeters of the water. The hungry crocodile, lured by the odor,
springs at the bait, and gets the hook between his jaws. It is seldom
that by dint of frantic pulling and wriggling he does not free the
bamboo and rush off to one of his favorite haunts, where, by the
presence of the bamboo float above him, he is discovered and
dispatched.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B6"></a>
<h4>HUNTING IMPLEMENTS</h4>

<a name="2B61"></a>
<h5>THE SPEAR</h5>
</center>

<p>The chief weapon used in the chase is the spear. It consists of a
stout, wooden shaft between 2.1 and 2.4 meters long, which is set into
the hollow conical socket of a spearhead. The blade in general
appearance resembles the more serious weapon of war, but it is only
about 10 or 12 centimeters long and makes no pretense to beauty, being
fashioned solely for utilitarian purposes. As a necessary accessory to
the spear the inseparable bolo is carried.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B62"></a>
<h5>THE BOW AND ARROW</h5>
</center>

<p>In the chapter on hunting reference has been made already to the
hunting bow and arrow. It is an ordinary bow, but the arrow differs in
not being feathered and finished like the arrow intended for human
game.</p>

<p>A very effective and easily made arrow consists of a piece of bamboo
about 85 centimeters long and 3 to 4 millimeters in diameter, with a
sharp tapering point. In lieu of feathering, four or five tufts near one
extremity, set at a distance of about 2.5 centimeters from each other,
are made by scraping the surface so as to form little tufts of shavings.
This style of dart arrow is used principally for monkeys, but a supply
is always on hand for warlike purposes, when the more finished and
efficient arrows become exhausted.</p>

<p>Another difference in the hunting arrow is the 2-pronged bamboo head
formed either by splitting a regular bamboo arrow or, more commonly, by
lashing together two arrows. I saw on a few occasions <i>palma brava</i>
spike heads used by the Manóbos of the far upper Agúsan. These latter
forms are used exclusively for hornbills whose tough hide and abundant
plumage require something stronger than the ordinary arrow.</p>

<center>
<a name="2B63"></a>
<h5>THE BLOWGUN</h5>
</center>

<p>The blowgun<sup>28</sup> is used sporadically and perfunctorily on
the far upper Agúsan, but I have never seen it anywhere else among
Manóbos.<sup>29</sup> It is used for shooting small birds, chickens, and
mice. It is made of an internode of a variety of bamboo<sup>30</sup>
about 1.2 meters long and 12.5 millimeters in diameter, to which is
joined another internode about 20 centimeters long and of slightly
larger diameter. This forms the mouthpiece. I have never seen any
'decorative work on a blowpipe. The dart is a thin tapering piece of
bamboo about 35 centimeters long and 1.5 millimeters in diameter at the
butt. Enough cotton to fill the bore of the gun is fastened at the butt
end of the dart. It is discharged by the breath. The point is never
poisoned, nor is there any tradition as to the former use of poison on
these darts.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup><i>Sum-pí-tan</i>.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup>Its use by the Mandáyas of the Kati'il, Manorígau, and
Karága Rivers is very common, but so far as I know it is neither a
defensive nor an offensive weapon.</p>

<p><sup>30</sup><i>La-hi'</i>.</p>

<p>The blowgun, when in use, is held to the mouth with the right hand.
The maximum range is about 20 meters. I have seen very small birds
killed at a distance of about 8 meters.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<h3>INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES</h3>

<a name="2C1"></a>
<h4>DIVISION OF LABOR</h4>
</center>

<p>It is to be expected that among a people whose women have been
obtained practically by purchase the burden of work will fall on the
woman. The Manóbo man, however, at times performs an amount of heavy,
hard work that makes the division somewhat equitable.</p>

<center>
<a name="2C11"></a>
<h5>MALE ACTIVITIES</h5>
</center>

<p>House building, hunting, fishing, and trapping fall to the lot of the
man. When the rice-planting season is at hand, he fells the trees and
does the heavier work of clearing. An occasional war raid or an
occasional visit to some distant settlement for trading purposes may
impose upon him a few days of hard travel. Outside of these occupations
his work is comparatively light. He attends to his weapons, makes such
objects of wood or of bamboo as may be needed, and decorates them after
his style. He splits the rattan and does nearly all the plait work in
basket making. All the necessary implements for fishing, hunting, and
trapping are made by him, with the exception of steel weapons. He strips
the <i>abaká</i> for the family clothes and procures the dye plants. In
certain districts he is the miner and in others he is the boat builder,
and in all districts he conducts trading transactions.</p>

<center>
<a name="2C12"></a>
<h5>FEMALE ACTIVITIES</h5>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo woman certainly has her share of work. She does all the
dyeing, weaving, and tailoring, besides attending to the various
household duties of providing fuel, food, and water. These latter
occupations impose upon her at least one trip daily to the <i>camote</i>
field, and several to the watering place, which in the mountainous
districts is ordinarily at a considerable distance down steep and rugged
trails. She attends to the children and cares for the sick, and day
after day dries, pounds, winnows and cooks the rice. When her helpmate
has felled the trees for the new farm, she does the looping, lighter
clearing, burning, sowing, weeding, tilling, and harvesting. In her
spare moments she makes mats, rice bags, and earthen vessels, braids an
occasional armlet, does the beadwork, and a thousand and one little
things according to the exigency of the moment or the requirements of
her spouse.</p>

<center>
<a name="2C2"></a>
<h4>MALE INDUSTRIES IN DETAIL</h4>
</center>

<p>The various operations of fishing, hunting, trapping, house building,
agriculture, and trading have been already described so that there
remain to be considered only boat building, mining, and plait work.</p>

<center>
<a name="2C21"></a>
<h5>BOAT BUILDING</h5>
</center>

<p>The art of boat building is known only to Manóbos who have been in
contact with Banuáons, so that one would be led to think that the art is
of Banuáon origin. It is confined practically to the Kasilaían, Líbang,
Maásam, Óhut, and Wá-wa Rivers, though one finds a boat builder here and
there on the Híbung River and on the Simúlau River, but only an
occasional one, if any, on the Argáwan, Umaíam, Ihawán, and upper
Agúsan.</p>

<p>The boat is a dugout usually made of <i>magasinó'</i>,
<i>kalántas</i>, or some light durable wood. The tree is selected, hewed
down with the simple ax, and by dint of hard chopping hollowed out and
shaped. In this way are made nearly all the skiffs, canoes, and boats
that ply up the network of rivers in the Agúsan Valley. It is not
uncommon to see a <i>banca</i>, or large boat, 10 meters long by 1 meter
beam.</p>

<center>
<a name="2C22"></a>
<h5>MINING</h5>
</center>

<p>Mining is confined to the Híbung River and its tributaries, to the
Wá-wa River, and to the Taligamán district, a few hours' walk to the
southeast of Butuán. It is a desultory occupation followed more at the
request of Bisáya traders, or in fulfillment of a contract, than out of
any desire for gold.</p>

<p>The time selected is usually after a flood. The gold is washed out
with a circular, hollow, wooden pan.<sup>1</sup> The operation has an
established religious procedure which, must be followed if one wishes to
be successful in the acquisition of the gold. The theory is as follows:
The gold is the property of a gold spirit, whose place in the Manóbo
pantheon I can not state. To enter upon his domains and to remove the
ore which is his without feasting him and making him a present of a
living victim for a future repast would provoke his wrath and result in
failure to obtain the object of the search. Hence the leader of the
miners upon arrival at the mining ground turns loose a white fowl and
kills a white pig in honor of the gold spirit. He also presents to the
spirit leaf packages of boiled native rice. The mining operations then
begin, but the peculiar feature of the whole procedure is that the rice
packages are purchased from the leader at the rate of 1
<i>ku-len-tás-on</i><sup>2</sup> for two packages. Noise and merriment
are interdicted during the mining operations as being displeasing to the
gold spirit, but if, upon infringement of this taboo, further oblations
of rice are made to him he resumes his good humor and permits the gold
to be found.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Bi-ling-án</i>.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>Ku-len-tás-on</i> are said to weigh one-half of the
gold piece that was in circulation in the Philippine Islands, in
pre-American days, and which was valued at 12.5 cents United States
currency.</p>

<p>I found these beliefs to be held as far over as the upper Tágo River,
on the eastern side of the Pacific Cordillera.</p>

<center>
<a name="2C23"></a>
<h5>PLAITING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES</h5>
</center>

<p>The plaiting and braiding of such objects as arm and leg ligatures
out of <i>nito</i> or other vegetable fiber nearly always falls to the
lot of the women. The plaiting of baskets out of rattan, as well as the
making of fish traps and pack baskets, is generally a male
occupation.</p>

<p>The process of basket making is fairly simple. A more or less
cylindrical, solid piece of wood with flat bottom and top forms the mold
upon which the strips of rattan are interlaced. A circular band of
bamboo strengthens the upper rim, a coating of the pulp of the seed of
the <i>tabon-tábon</i> fills up the crevices and makes the basket almost
perfectly water-tight.</p>

<p>Pack baskets that are used for carrying game and for general utility
on long voyages are of the open wickerwork description.</p>

<p>I know of only two Manóbo blacksmiths in the whole of Manóboland.
They learned the trade from Bisáyas and produce bolos much like the
Bisáya or Bohol type seen in the Agúsan Valley. Here and there one meets
a Manóbo who understands how to beat out a fish spear or a fishhook, or
to make a crude pipe, but, with these exceptions, the Manóbo knows
nothing of steel or iron work.</p>

<p>As to the decoration, it is manifest from what has been said that he
can do simple but creditable work. The ornaments on bamboo tubes, combs,
baskets, and certain other things are evidences of his skill. So are the
tattoo and embroidery designs described in a previous chapter.</p>

<center>
<a name="2C3"></a>
<h4>FEMALE INDUSTRIES IN DETAIL</h4>

<a name="2C31"></a>
<h5>WEAVING AND ITS ACCESSORY PROCESSES</h5>
</center>

<p><i>Abaká</i> fiber is stripped by men and delivered to the womenfolk.
The women pound it for a long time in a wooden mortar to soften it, then
patiently tie strand to strand, placing it carefully in small hollow
baskets, where it is free from danger of entangling. Sand is often
sprinkled on it as a further means of preventing tangling.</p>

<p>Cotton yarn is prepared from the native plant by means of a very
primitive spindle, which consists of a small rod of wood at the end of
which is a top-shaped piece of the same material which serves to sustain
the necessary rotation. A tuft of cotton is attached to the end of this
bar, and, as the top rotates the thread is twisted. When the thread is
sufficiently long it is wound around the handle and the operation is.
repeated. By this slow and tedious process a sufficient amount of yarn
is spun for the requirements of the spinner.</p>

<p>The dyeing process consists in boiling the <i>abaká</i> yarn with
finely chopped pieces of various woods.<sup>3</sup> In order to produce
a permanent dye, the process of boiling must be repeated more than once
with new dyeing material. As the boiling apparatus consists nearly
always of small earthen pots and the boiling is continually interrupted
by culinary operations, it is obvious that the process is an
inordinately slow and unsatisfactory one. I am of the opinion that to
produce a fast red dye on sufficient yarn for about seven skirts, the
boiling occupies the better part of two wrecks.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Si-ká-lig</i> root for red effects, pieces of
<i>kanai-yum</i> tree for black and pieces of <i>du-au</i> for yellow
effects.</p>

<p>Cotton yarn is never dyed. Whenever colors are desired, imported
cotton must be obtained through Christian or Christianized
intermediaries.</p>

<p>The weaving is performed on a simple, portable loom, consisting of
two internodes of bamboo, one at the back part and one at the front
part. The warp threads pass serially around these two pieces of bamboo
and between the slits of a primitive comb situated within arm reach of
the posterior bamboo internode. The comb consists of an oblong rectangle
about 80 by 5 centimeters, having a series of little reeds set parallel
at a distance of 1.5 millimeters from each other. Through these
interstices pass the warp threads. Just beyond this comb and farther
away from the weaver is a hardwood rood[sic], as wide as the weft,
around which are single loops of <i>abaká</i> or other fiber. Through
these loops pass alternately the warp threads in such a way that when
the batten is inserted the upper and lower alternate warp threads are
reversed, thereby holding the weft threads in the position to which they
have been driven by the batten.</p>

<p>The weft thread is wound upon a bobbin made out of a slender piece of
rattan which has two slits at each end, through which the weft thread
passes. The bobbin is driven through by the hand from side to side and
between the upper and the lower warp threads. The heavy, hardwood, flat,
polished batten is then worked by the hand, driving the weft thread into
juxtaposition with the part of the fabric finished already. The weaver
then inserts the batten between the warp threads at the point where they
alternately pass up and down through the previously mentioned loops on
the distal side of the comb, and between it and the rod that holds the
loops. By pulling the comb back to the finished part of the fabric, the
warp threads are reversed and the last weft thread is securely held in
place. Thus the process is repeated over and over again until the fabric
is finished.</p>

<p>The setting up of a piece of skirt cloth would occupy some two whole
days of uninterrupted work and the weaving some three days, but as
multitudinous household duties call the woman away constantly, she
spends the better part of at least two weeks on one piece, this period
not including the preparation of the yarn by tying and dyeing.</p>

<p>In weaving the woman sits upon the floor and keeps the warp threads
stretched by a rope that passes round her back from each extremity of
the yarn beam. When not in use, the web and the finished fabric are
folded up around the beam.</p>

<p>The products of the Manóbo loom are not as numerous and artistic as
those of the Mandáyas. The cloth produced is of four kinds: (1) The
ordinary skirt or mosquito-bar cloth made out of <i>abaká</i> fiber and
having white and black longitudinal warp stripes, alternating with the
stripes of the red background; (2) a closely woven but thin cloth of
<i>abaká</i> having sometimes, as in the case of men's jackets, straight
weft stripes of imported blue cotton; (3) a cloth of the same material,
but so thin as to be diaphanous, and not adorned with any stripes; (4) a
cloth for trousers made out of an <i>abaká</i> warp and a native cotton
woof.</p>

<p>In the chapter on dress reference has been made to the elaborate and
beautiful effects produced by the Mandáyas on <i>abaká</i> cloth. The
Manóbo woman has no knowledge of the process by which such effects are
obtained.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the two yarn beams are cut in such a
manner as to emit a booming sound at each stroke of the batten. I have
seen an additional internode attached to the end yarn beam in a vertical
position, with a view to increasing the resonance. The object of these
sounders is to call attention to the industry and assiduity of the
weaver.</p>

<center>
<a name="2C32"></a>
<h5>POTTERY</h5>
</center>

<p>The whole pottery industry consists in the making of rude earthen
pots out of clay. It is confined to places near which the proper clay is
found. A piece of clay is kneaded and mixed with fine sand till it
attains the proper consistency. A piece is then laid over a round stone
and beaten gently till it becomes sufficiently dry and rigid to serve
for a bottom to which clay is added strip by strip, at first thick but
gradually thinned with the fingers, until the pot is completed. It is in
the union of these strips that defects are liable to occur. Hence the
best workers patiently sit for hours beating their pots with a little
wooden mallet. The pots are then put into a hot fire and burnt several
times till they become sufficiently brittle to resist the fire, but the
manufacturers seem to lack a proper test, because the cracking of a new
pot is an ordinary occurrence.</p>

<p>The pot is spherical in shape with a wide mouth and a neck which, by
its incurving, makes it possible to hang it up by means of a piece of
rattan when it is not in use. There may be a few indentations running
around the neck for the purpose of decoration. It is customary to
provide the pot with a crude cover, also made of sand and clay.</p>

<center>
<a name="2C33"></a>
<h5>TAILORING AND MAT MAKING</h5>
</center>

<p>Tailoring is such a simple affair in Manóboland that it hardly
deserves mention. Whenever an imported needle of European or American
make is not to be had, a piece of brass wire is filed down and an eye
made in it. With the simple utensil and with a thread of <i>abaká</i>
fiber, the garment is sewn with a kind of a transverse cross-stitch.
When imported cotton is on hand, nearly all seams are covered with
either a continuous fringe of cotton in alternate colors or with neat
wavy stitches, all of which serve both to conceal the seams and to
embellish the garment.</p>

<p>In making a garment the piece of cloth is folded into a rectangle
which forms the body of the garment. A piece large enough to make the
sleeves remains. No piece is thrown away, there being no superfluous
clippings. All cutting is done with a bolo.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p><sup>4</sup>In the chapter on dress reference has been made to the
method of embroidery and to the various designs in common use.</p>

<p>Mats and bags are made out of <i>pandanus</i>. The same methods so
commonly used throughout the Philippine Islands are employed by the
Manóbos.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<h3>DOMESTIC LIFE AND MARITAL RELATIONS</h3>

<a name="3D1"></a>
<h4>ARRANGING THE MARRIAGE</h4>
</center>

<p>Manóbo marriages, in general, may be said to be unions of convenience
sought with a view to extending the circle of relatives in such
directions as may result in an increase of power, prestige, protection,
and sundry other material advantages. An instance passed under my notice
in 1909 in which the daughter of a Mañgguáñgan warrior chief was
captured in marriage for the purpose of securing his aid against the
captor's enemies. The captor was a Manóbo-Mañgguáñgan of the upper
Agúsan.</p>

<center>
<a name="3D11"></a>
<h5>SELECTION OF THE BRIDE</h5>
</center>

<p>In the selection of his future wife, the Manóbo consults his own
tastes as far as he can, but he is influenced to a great extent by the
opinion of his parents and near relatives, all of whom ordinarily look
to the advantages to be derived from connection with powerful members of
the tribe. Hence rank and birth are nearly always a determining factor,
and where the wishes of the man's elders are in opposition to his own
natural choice, he yields and is contented to take the helpmate chosen
for him.</p>

<center>
<a name="3D12"></a>
<h5>COURTSHIP AND ANTENUPTIAL RELATIONS</h5>
</center>

<p>Sometimes the young man is bidden to take up his residence in the
girl's house, observe her general character and especially her
diligence, find out if she has been bespoken, gain the good will of her
father and relatives, and report to his people.</p>

<p>No communication of any kind takes place between him and his
prospective wife. When the subject is broached to the girl, she simply
bids him see her relatives. I have known of cases among the upper Agúsan
Manóbos where improper suggestions to the girl were at once reported by
her to her parents, and the author of them was at once brought to order
with a fine, the equivalent of P15 or P30. One white man is reported to
have met his death at the hand of a Manóbo for a mistake of this kind
many years ago. In deepest Manóboland, when the offense passes, however
slightly, the boundaries of suggestion, it becomes the source of many a
deadly feud. Happily, however, such cases are extremely rare.</p>

<p>Three, four, or five of the nearest male relatives of the man, after
procuring a little beverage, repair early some evening to the house of
the nearest relative of the girl. After they have partaken of the
inevitable betel-nut quid, and have offered a drink of sugarcane brew or
other beverage to the household, and have discussed a few topics of
daily life--it may be about the last wild boar killed, or the capture of
a polecat in the snares<sup>1</sup>--the prologue begins. This lasts
from one to two days, including often the better part of the nights.
Each of the visitors comes in his turn and rattles off, with many a
significant haw and cough, in good Manóbo style a series of periphrastic
platitudes and examples that apparently give no clue to the object of
their visit. The owner of the house and father, let us say, of the girl
quickly understands the situation and then assumes a most indifferent
air. The visitor who has taken up the discourse continues, with never a
care for the various household sounds, such as the chopping of wood, or
the yelping of dogs; and not even the announcement of supper, and the
partaking thereof, can stay his eloquence. The householder at times
emits a sleepy grunt of approval, relapses apparently into a drowse, and
after several hours, rolls into his mat and feigns sleep. At this
juncture one of the visitors hastens down the notched pole and gets the
silver-ferruled lance or silver-sheathed knife that has been left
concealed near the house. The spokesman of the visitors then offers it
to the father of the hoped-for bride on condition that he rise and
listen, for they have come with an object in view--to beg for the hand
of his daughter. It is then his turn to begin a painfully drawn-out
discourse, to which the visitors assent periodically with many an humble
and submissive &#34;<i>ho</i>&#34; and &#34;<i>ha</i>,&#34; &#34;<i>bai
da man</i>&#34; (yes, indeed), and so forth. He strains and racks his
brains to think of every imaginable reason against the marriage, and
finally, after he has exhausted every resource, he bids his visitors go
home and come back on such a day, because he has to consult his
relatives; but he can not get them to stir until he gives them a
counterpresent, which he claims is of much more value than their present
to him.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Lítag</i>.</p>

<p>On the appointed day the young man's relatives again proceed to the
same house, but in this case reinforced by all the relatives within
reach, each one carrying his present.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival the same performance is repeated and the same
tactics pursued as before, except that this time the visitors kill their
fatted pig and set it out, inviting the householder and all his
relatives to partake, but, lo and behold! no one will eat. No amount of
persuasion will induce them--they have eaten already--they are all
sick--they do not like to be invited to eat by their visitors, it being
against all the rules of hospitality, etc. To all of these objections
the visitors by turn answer, offsetting one reason by another and all
the while trying to put the other people into good humor and soften
their hearts. But no, the owner of the house and his party refuse, and
all this while the fatted pig lies in big black chunks on the floor,
surrounded by rice in platters, baskets, and leaves. At this point a few
of the visitors again hasten down the notched pole, and gather up out of
the grass or underbrush in the adjacent jungle the concealed presents.
The arrival of the presents is a grand moment for the father and
relatives of the young man. Even the future bride, who up to this time
has coyly hidden away in a corner, can not help stealing a few peeps at
the display of spears, bolos, daggers, plates, and jars.</p>

<p>Picking them up one by one the owner descants on their beauty, their
value (naming an outrageous sum), and his relatives express their sorrow
at parting with them. &#34;But,&#34; he goes on to say, &#34;it matters
not, provided that you see our good will and will join us in this
banquet.&#34; Whereupon he distributes among his guests according to the
order of their standing the array of presents, after which all squat
down and begin to eat, the visitors giving an extra dose of wassail to
their friends in order that under its warming influence they may soften
and yield.</p>

<p>During the course of the meal, the discussion is continued and every
appeal made to motives of friendship and self-interest, but in vain--the
other side shows no signs of yielding; they say that they can not yet
make a fixed contract, that the girl is too young, or that she does not
want the suitor; and so the hosts are bade to have patience and to go
their way. But now that they have spent an amount varying from P30 to
P50 they are not minded to lose it, but will persist in their suit for
years. I have heard of marriage transactions that covered 10 years and
have personal knowledge of numerous cases that have extended over 6.</p>

<p>The case of a Manóbo in Pilar, upper Agúsan, will illustrate the
point. His father, during the interregnum of 1898, first made the
proposal for the hand of the girl. It was refused until toward the end
of 1904 the parents finally yielded, but on condition that 10 slaves be
paid. A few months subsequently, after a course of hard haggling and
cunning bargaining, the contract was modified to four slaves plus the
equivalent of the value of six. Three slaves were delivered after a raid
on a Mañgguáñgan settlement on the middle Sálug (about April, 1905). The
6 &#34;thirties,&#34;<sup>2</sup> or P180, were paid in lances, knives,
and other things before the demise of the father toward the latter part
of 1905, so that one slave still remained to be delivered. On my last
visit to Pilar (February, 1910) the poor fiancé was still doing chores
around his mother-in-law's house, and the slave was still unpaid. If he
can not procure that slave it will probably cost him, in other effects,
several times the value of the slave.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>Kat-lo-án</i>, meaning 30, is a monetary unit,
representing the value of a good slave.</p>

<p>Proceedings of the kind described before are repeated at frequent
intervals for a number of years, but with this exception, that on the
ensuing visits presents of no great value are bestowed on the father of
the expected bride--a bunch of bananas, a piece of venison, or a few
chickens, or some such offering are made, with a reiteration of the
petition. A capacious porker with a bounteous supply of sugar-cane brew
in big bamboo internodes is brought along occasionally to break down the
obdurateness of the householder's heart, until one fine day, under the
benign influence of &#34;the cup that cheers,&#34; he yields, but
intimating that his petitioners can never afford the marriage
payments.<sup>3</sup> He will then probably recount the purchase price
of this own wife, always with exaggerations; descant on the qualities of
his daughter, her strength, her beauty, her diligence, her probable
fecundity; and deplore the grievous loss to be sustained by her
departure from her parents' side. Whereupon the visitors respond that
they are willing to substitute a number of slaves to make up for the
loss of the daughter, but that in any case she will not leave the
paternal home and that the bridegroom will take up his residence there
and help his father-in-law in all things; and so the matter is discussed
and the payment of a certain number of slaves is determined in the
following manner:</p>

<center>
<a name="3D14"></a>
<h5>DETERMINATION OF THE MARRIAGE PAYMENT</h5>
</center>

<p>Determination of the marriage payment is the very soul of the whole
marriage proceeding. Years and years of service on the part of the
would-be husband, presents innumerable on the part of his relatives, and
feigned indifference or opposition on the other side have led up to this
moment. For the sake of clearness, let us call the father or nearest
male relative of the future bride A and the father or nearest male
relative of the bridegroom, B.</p>

<p>A, aided by all the cunning of his relatives, lays down as a
condition, let us say, seven slaves and one female relative of B, who is
to be a substitute for his daughter. To this B rejoins that it is a high
price and impossible of fulfillment, that he is not a warrior chief, nor
a <i>datu</i>, nor such a wealthy person as A, and that he can never
satisfy such a demand, giving a thousand and one reasons, such as
sickness or debt. A responds and belittles him for being so deficient in
resources, asks if B wants to get a wife for his son gratuitously, and
tells him to go home and buy a slave girl for him. He yells indignation
at the top of his voice, probably with his hand on his bolo, in a very
menacing way.</p>

<p>B and his party, seeing that it is unavailing, go home, consult over
the matter, and during the course of a year or two take every possible
means to procure the necessary slaves. They may be successful in
securing one or more, let us say two, and at the same time may manage to
get together, say, 5 lances, 6 bolos, 2 jars, 30 plates, and 5 pigs; and
so one fine day they start off to A's for another trial.</p>

<p>B proceeds to make A feel merry before he reports his failure to
comply with the demand. This report is usually a tissue of the most
atrocious &#34;oriental diplomacies&#34; that the human mind can
concoct. A listens to this prologue, interlarded as it always is with
ejaculations of corroboration from B's party. Then A begins: It is an
outrage, he will have none of the pigs; the idea of selling his daughter
for a bunch of pigs! He gets up and says he will first kill the pigs and
then the owner, but his relatives make a pretense at restraining him.
After a few hours of this simulation, by which he has induced B to make
many gifts, he softens, but as the demand was not complied with to the
letter, the payment must be increased, he says, by 4 more pigs, a piece
of Chinese cloth, 8 Mandáya skirts, and 2 jars. At this point his
relatives interfere. His sister wants three pigs and four skirts. She
was midwife at the birth of the girl in question and, due to her contact
with the unclean blood, was approached by a foul spirit and fell sick.
Surely she deserves a big payment--1 female slave, 2 pigs, 2 shell
bracelets, and a piece of turkey red cloth. And the third cousin claims
that she nursed the child, the future bride, two months during the
illness of its mother, and demands two Mandáya skirts. And so the
haggling is continued, A and his party doling out the marriage effects
as sparingly as possible, taking care to make presents to the more
vehement and unyielding parties on the other side.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Ábat</i>.</p>

<p>This operation always lasts a few days, during which B keeps his
prospective relatives in high glee with pork and potations, until A
consents.</p>

<center>
<a name="3D15"></a>
<h5>THE MARRIAGE FEAST AND PAYMENT</h5>
</center>

<p>The marriage feast almost invariably takes place during the harvest,
for the simple reason that food is more abundant and also because the
harvest days are the gladdest of all the year. When the time for the
marriage is close at hand the father-in-law makes an announcement to
friends and neighbors, sending out messengers and leaving at each house
a rattan strip<sup>4</sup> to indicate the number of days to elapse
before the marriage. If his own house is not sufficiently large for the
expected attendance, he changes to another and awaits the eventful
day.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>Ba-lén-tus</i>.</p>

<p>The whole country flocks to the house at the appointed time, the
relatives of the bridegroom being loaded down with the marriage
presents, which are all carefully concealed in baskets, leaf wraps,
etc., and are deposited secretly in the woods adjoining the house. Of
course the omen bird must be consulted. On this occasion above all
others it is essential that the omens be favorable, as there are no
means, so I have been informed, to counteract an inauspicious marriage
omen. While preparations are being made for the banquet by the
bridegroom's party, the interminable parley<sup>5</sup> is continued.
The bride's father and relatives make their last efforts for securing
all they can in worldly effects. They almost repent of the bargain--it
was too cheap--think of the price paid for the bride's mother--the
expenses incurred during a long illness of the bride in her infancy--and
compare the modicum demanded for her marriage; it is outrageous! no, the
marriage can not go on, the girl is not in good health, and the ordeal
might increase her ailment. Every sort of trick is resorted to in order
that the other side may be more generous in the bestowal of gifts. The
discussion is thus one big tissue of simulation, and is carried on in
succession by the elders on each side. The bridegroom's father keeps
offering betel nut and brew to his new
&#34;cofather-in-law&#34;<sup>6</sup> and selects a favorable moment to
make him a big present, possibly of an old heirloom, a jar, or a
venerable old spear, the value of which he estimates at P50, although it
may be worth only P8.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup><i>Bi-sä</i>.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup><i>Bá'-i</i>.</p>

<p>The meal is finally spread out on the floor. The roasted part of the
pig has been hacked into small chunks and is piled up on plates, leaves,
bark platters, and shallow baskets. The boiled portion remains in
charred bamboo internodes placed close at hand. The rice is loaded on
plates, or placed in large baskets lined with leaves, and the beverage
is put in the ancient family jars, or is left in long bamboos: The host,
in this case the bridegroom's father or nearest male relative, assisted
by a few others, distributes the meat, carefully selecting the pieces
according to weight, size, and quality, so that no one can complain of
not having had as good a share as his neighbor. Such toothsome parts as
the brains, heart, and liver are divided among the relatives who enjoy
greater prestige, the tougher and more gizzly[sic] pieces falling to the
lot of the people of lesser importance. This operation takes up the
better part of an hour. It is needless to say that a hubbub of voices
helps to give animation to the occasion. The Manóbo speaks in no angelic
whisper on ordinary occasions, but at a solemn time like this his vocal
chords twang with all the intensity of which they are capable.</p>

<p>Finally all squat down on the floor, armed with the inseparable bolo
if suspicious visitors are present. Hands are washed by pouring a little
water out of a bowl, tumbler, or bamboo joint; the mouth is rinsed, and
the meal is begun. With their right hands on their bolos, if they have
not ungirded[sic] them, they lay their left hands over their portions of
rice, knead handfuls of it into a compact mass, and raising their hands
to their mouths ram it in with the palms.</p>

<p>The two &#34;cofathers-in-law&#34; pay special attention to each
other, each trying to get the other intoxicated, and each feeding the
other with chunks of fat and other things. This custom is called
<i>daiyápan</i> and is universal among the non-Christian tribes of the
Agúsan Valley. It is a mark of esteem and the highest token of
hospitality. A few pieces of fat and bone are scooped up, dipped in a
mixture of red pepper, salt, and water and thrust, nolens volens, into
the mouth of the good fellow whom it is desired to honor. And it is not
good etiquette to remove it. It must be gorged at once and the fortunate
man must proceed to reciprocate in the same way. The brew is distributed
in tumblerfuls or in bamboo joints holding about a tumblerful each. To
refuse the allotted portion would degrade one in the eyes of everyone,
for here it is a sin to be sober and a virtue to get drunk. Gluttony
finds no place in a Manóbo dictionary--one is merely full,<sup>7</sup>
but always ready to go on; friend divides his rice with friend, when he
sees that the latter's supply is getting low, and his own is immediately
replenished by one of the womenfolk, or slaves that attend to the
culinary work. Nor must one finish before anybody else. It is not
polite. Nothing must be left on the plate, a fact that each one makes
clear by washing the plate clean with water.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>Mahántoi</i>.</p>

<p>The pandemonium increases in direct proportion as the brew
diminishes. One's neighbor may be yelling to somebody else at the other
end of the house while the latter is trying at the top of his voice to
reach the fellow that sits far away from him. Goodnatured, though rather
inelegant, jokes and jests are howled at the bride, who coyly conceals
herself behind a neighbor, and at the bridegroom, who does not seem at
all abashed. The women, who eat all together near the hearth, carry on
the same operations but in their own more gentle way, never falling
under the influence of the liquor. The meal is usually finished in about
three hours, when the pig and rice are exhausted.</p>

<p>After a chew of betel nut, comes the supreme moment for
payment,<sup>8</sup> ushered in by many a &#34;<i>ho</i>&#34; and
&#34;<i>ha</i>&#34; with another discussion. The tenor of this is that
the father of the bridegroom is not as well provided with
goods<sup>9</sup> as he had desired to be, owing, let us say, to a
failure to obtain certain effects he had ordered from so-and-so,
together with numerous other pretexts and excuses that on the face of
them are untrue. Pointing out his slaves, he descants on them; and goes
on to explain how much trouble he had to get them; he could not value
them for less than P80 apiece. Or, if they are captives, he describes
the fatigues of his march and the imminent danger to which he was
exposed during the attack, together with such other reasons, mostly
fictitious, as would tend to enhance their value and thereby avoid
subsequent haggling. He then delivers the other goods
demanded.<sup>10</sup> Where two slaves had been asked he gives two
kinds of goods,<sup>11</sup> say a lance and a bolo, whereupon there is
invariably a howl of dissatisfaction, according to custom. But things
are settled nicely either by granting a few plates or some such thing
for a solace, or by playing on the good will or simplicity of the person
who objected. The distribution is not completed in one day. Usually
about one-third of the entire amount of goods is held over with a view
to observing if there is anyone who is not quite pleased with his
portion, and also for the purpose of keeping up their hopes.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Á-bat</i>.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup><i>Máng-gad</i>.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>By his cofather-in-law and relatives.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup><i>Da-dú-a no baíyo no máng-gad</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3D16"></a>
<h5>THE RECIPROCATORY PAYMENT AND BANQUET</h5>
</center>

<p>The following day, or whenever the payment has been completed, begins
the reciprocatory payment<sup>12</sup> in which the bride's relatives
return to those of the bridegroom a certain amount of goods varying in
value, but approximately one-half of what has been paid as the marriage
portion. As a soother, they also kill a pig and right earnestly set
about putting their new circle of relatives in good humor. It may be
noted that the duration of these feasts depends on the rapidity with
which the pig is dispatched. I have known a marriage feast to cover a
period of seven days, though it may be said that it is generally
terminated the second day, at least in the case of less well-to-do
Manóbos.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Sú-bak</i>.</p>

<p>The reciprocatory payment being successfully carried through, it now
remains for the bridegroom's relatives to give the farewell feast and
carry off the bride. But it often happens that the girl's relatives have
ascertained that there are still a number of goods in the possession of
their new relatives and it is considered proper to secure them.</p>

<p>A few hours before departure the bride is decked out with all
available ornaments. Bead necklaces, with pendants of crocodile teeth
and strips of mother-of-pearl; bracelets of seashell,<sup>13</sup>
large, white and heavy; bracelets of vegetable fiber and of sea wood; a
comb inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and adorned with beads and tassels of
cotton; leglets of plaited jungle fiber--all these constitute her
finery. During the process of dressing, the bride's female relatives
usually weep, while the more distant ones set up a howl, often, I think,
of ficticious[sic] grief, in which the children, babies, and dogs may
join. At this juncture the female relatives of the bridegroom intercede
and endeavor to assuage their grief. It is only after numerous presents
have been given them that they become resigned, but at the last moment,
when the bride is about to be led away, they surround her and hold her
and perhaps repeat the wail till they receive more material consolation.
This necessitates another supply of presents. Then the children have to
be appeased. Finally the girl is led down the pole, but as her father
may have espied, let us say, a fine dagger, or a lance that struck his
fancy, nothing will satisfy him except to order them all back and tell
his cofather-in-law that he must needs have the lance or dagger, giving
some sly reason, as, for instance, that his wife had an ominous dream
last night. In one marriage feast that I witnessed, after all the
bridegroom's people had left the house, the bride's father told his son
to beat the dog. Whereupon he ordered the party back and told his
cofather-in-law that it was passing strange that the dog should have
howled just as they left the house and that he should leave his lance
and bolo as an offering to one of the family deities. It was done
accordingly and in all good nature. Then they started off again, but
were recalled because the old fox happened to remember that his
cofather-in-law had on several occasions during the early marriage
proceedings displeased him, and so it became necessary to atone for the
sin<sup>14</sup> by another gift. Finally they got a start, filched of
all they had. It happens frequently that the marriage suitors are
deprived even of their personal weapons and of part of their clothes. It
may be remarked that the bestowal of a person's upper garment is
considered an act of deep friendship, and is of fairly frequent
occurrence.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Tak-ló-bo</i> (<i>Tridacna gigas</i>).</p>

<p><sup>14</sup><i>Húgad to saí-ya</i>. This is another instance of that
peculiar belief in an atonement rite of which I can give no details.</p>

<p>The above is a description of the upper class marriage feast, but
that of the poorer class is carried on in much the same style, except
that the proceedings are much briefer. The bride's father and people on
the one hand strive by might and main to get the highest payment
obtainable, while the bridegroom's folk exert themselves to hold the
price down. Whatever is given in payment is overvalued--it is a
keepsake, an heirloom, would never be given away under any other
circumstances--in fact, may result in evil to the giver. On the other
hand everything that is received is depreciated--it is old, or of no use
to the receiver. An old trick is to return it, whereupon a little
additional gift is made for a consolation. But even then it is never
admitted that the gift is received for its intrinsic value, but rather
out of good will.</p>

<h4>MARRIAGE AND MARRIAGE CONTRACTS</h4>

<a name="3D21"></a>
<h5>THE MARRIAGE RITE</h5>
</center>

<p>We will now follow the bride to her father-in-law's house and witness
the religious ceremony by which the hymeneal tie is indissolubly
knitted. It is essential that the omen bird should be favorable on the
trip to the bridegroom's house, otherwise the party must return. Usually
the parting injunction of the bride's father to his cofather-in-law
warns him to watch for the omen bird.</p>

<p>A pig is killed as soon as possible and set out in the usual style at
the house of the bridegroom. The bride and bridegroom sit side by side
on an ordinary grass mat. No special decorations have been made; no
bridal chamber has been prepared, except sometimes a rude stall of
slatted bamboo or of bark.</p>

<p>When the meal is ready, the bridegroom takes a handful of rice from
his plate and offers it to the bride while she also gives a similar
portion to him. Then he passes his rice from hand to hand behind his
back seven times, after which he says in a loud voice: &#34;We are now
married; let our fame ascend.&#34;<sup>15</sup> The bride imitates him.
Whereupon loud howls of assent proclaim the consummation of the marriage
contract.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup><i>Kanámi no miño nakalíbto ang bántug námi</i>.</p>

<p>The meal goes on in the same riotous style as described before. I
seldom witnessed a marriage during which the bridegroom did not become
rather hilarious toward the end of the meal, but never displayed
anything but feelings of delicacy and respect toward the bride.
Instructions of a kind that would be considered highly indecent,
according to our standards of morality, are howled out in the most
candid way, so that this ordeal proves embarrassing for the bride. She
eats hastily and retires to her female friends in the cooking portion of
the house. I have seen several cases where the girl, being a mere child,
continued to weep during the whole proceeding.</p>

<p>The feast being concluded a female priest takes the betel-nut omen.
Seven quids of betel nuts are placed by one of the family priestesses
upon a sacred dish.<sup>16</sup> She then sets it upon the head of the
bridegroom and falls into an ecstatic condition, steadying the plate
with her hand. Should one of the betel-nut slices become separated from
its betel leaf, the omen is considered unpropitious and is followed
immediately by the prophylactic rite--the fowl-waving ceremony.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup><i>A-púg'-an</i>.</p>

<p>The matter of overcoming the delicacy of the newly married maiden is
not infrequently attended with considerable difficulty. It is
accomplished, however, by means of an elderly relative of the girl, who
occupies night after night the mat between the newly married couple,
until such time as she thinks that her ward has become well enough
acquainted with her husband so that she will not run away. The
go-between returns the following day and claims her guerdon. Several
cases passed under my observation, in which the husband was unable to
use his marital rights for weeks owing to the timorousness and
bashfulness of his youthful spouse. In no case was anything but patience
and gentleness displayed by the husband.</p>

<center>
<a name="3D22"></a>
<h5>MARRIAGE BY CAPTURE</h5>
</center>

<p>The custom of wife capture is fairly frequent, especially in the
upper Agúsan where the Manóbo is within the Mandáya culture area. During
my last visit to the upper Agúsan (September, 1909, to February, 1910)
three cases occurred, and I had the pleasure of taking part in the
settlement of one of them.</p>

<p>The capture is effected by a band of some four to eight friends of
the party interested. They repair to the vicinity of the <i>camote</i>
patch, which is almost invariably situated at some distance from the
house of its owner. Here a watch is kept until the intended captive, in
company probably with a few of her own tribe, appears upon the scene.
Probably it has been already ascertained that the male relatives have
gone on a hunting or fishing expedition, but to make assurance doubly
sure one or two of the party advance toward the women unarmed and make
inquiries hi an offhand way. If the absence of the male relatives is
confirmed, they thereupon seize the girl, and their companions rush out
in full panoply from their hiding places and carry off the fair prize.
By the time the girl's relatives become aware of the occurrence, the
captors have eluded all chance of discovery and the captive has probably
resigned herself to her fate, if she had not already consented by
connivance.</p>

<p>With regard to wife capture it may be remarked that it is generally
resorted to under the advice and protection of some more powerful and
affluent personage. If undertaken on one's own initiative it might be
risky, and certainly always is a highly expensive affair. Even when
carried out with the connivance of a <i>datu</i> or a warrior chief, it
has on occasions proved fatal, so I was assured.</p>

<p>The case referred to was that of the son of an influential Manóbo of
the Nábuk River, in the upper Agúsan Valley. His son had a few months
before my arrival lost his first wife in a raid made by a neighboring
settlement. He determined to avoid the prolixities and delay of the
ordinary matrimonial course, and, accordingly, captured the daughter of
a Mañgguáñgan warrior chief who lived near Pilar. I was in Compostela at
the time and on hearing that an expedition<sup>17</sup> to recapture the
girl or to collect the marriage payment would take place, I asked that I
might be allowed to accompany the party.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup><i>Duk-i-ús</i>. (Mandáya, <i>dúk-lus</i>).</p>

<p>We arrived at the house of the <i>datu</i> and found everything and
everybody prepared for war. This <i>datu</i> informed me that he
anticipated trouble, as the Mañgguáñgan was of a different breed, being
at times altogether unamenable to reason. During the rest of that day
nothing occurred, but no one ventured out of the clearing without a
strong guard, and during the night the strictest watch was maintained.
The <i>datu</i> said that among Manóbos and Mandáyas a wife capture was
easy of arrangement and was never attended with any trouble, provided
they had the wherewithal to pay the marriage price, but that the
Mañgguáñgan was an unruly character and in a fit of rage or drunkenness
was liable to commit acts of atrocity even against his nearest
relatives. He cited the case of a Mañgguáñgan from Sálug who discovered
the whereabouts of his son-in-law and of the captured bride and killed
them without further ado.</p>

<p>About 2 a. m. we were disturbed from our slumbers by one of the
watchers who had heard a distinct crackling in the adjoining forest.
This report brought everybody to his feet and provoked a chorus of yells
of intimidation, that never ceased till sunrise.</p>

<p>About 6 a. m. we espied forms in the forest, approaching from all
sides. When they, some 60 altogether, had taken up their positions on
the edge of the clearing wherein stood the house, they sounded their
weird and wild war whoop,<sup>18</sup> and four warriors, headed by the
warrior chief referred to, and armed with all the accouterments of war,
rushed forward toward the house, yelling, prancing around, defying,
challenging, and cursing. The warrior chief speared one of the two large
pigs under the house and proceeded, aided by his three companions to cut
down the house posts, never ceasing to yell in the most stentorian voice
I ever heard. At this juncture the <i>datu</i> let down with a long
strip of rattan a silver-banded lance, a silver-sheathed war knife, and
a silver-sheathed Mandáya dagger. As everybody was howling, it was
difficult to follow the tenor of conversation, but I observed that the
warrior chief accepted the gift though he did not apparently relax his
fury. He jumped around, menacing, and animating his companions to fire
the house. The <i>datu</i> kept letting down presents of lances, Mandáya
cloth, pigs, and other things until everyone of the assailants had
received a token of his good will. Their fury very visibly diminished,
and the <i>datu</i> was finally able to hold a colloquy with his new
cofather-in-law, in which he persuaded him to come up into the house and
hold a conference<sup>19</sup> over the matter. The latter, after
numerous reiterations that he would never enter the house except to chop
heads off, finally ascended the notched pole, followed by his braves. We
of the house retired to the further half, all armed, while the newcomers
squatted in that portion of the house near the ladder. Then began the
conference which lasted till breakfast was ready. It resembled in all
respects the usual marriage haggling, except that the warrior chief
asseverated persistently that the act of the <i>datu's</i> son was
deception and robbery, and that only blood would atone for it. His
companions howled assent and clutching their bolos, half rose as if to
begin a massacre. They were invited to sit down and regale themselves,
but that only made them howl all the more. Finally the <i>datu</i>
ordered out a stack of weapons and other presents, and made another
allotment to the visitors, in due proportion to relationship. This had a
soothing effect and induced them to drink copious draughts of sugarcane
brew, which kept on soothing them more and more as the end of the meal
approached. During all this time special attention was paid to the
warrior chief, so that before long he was feeling so happy that he
ordered his followers to remove all weapons from their persons, and
began to feed huge chunks of half-raw hog meat into the mouth of the
<i>datu</i> according to the immemorial custom.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup><i>Pa-nad-jáu-an</i>.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup><i>Bisa</i>.</p>

<p>After the feast I returned to the Agúsan but learned later that
everything had been settled amicably, the <i>datu</i> having provided a
superabundance of wordly[sic] effects, in payment for the captured
woman. Among them were two slaves valued at P30 apiece.</p>

<h5>PRENATAL MARRIAGE CONTRACTS AND CHILD MARRIAGE</h5>
</center>

<p>Prenatal marriage contracts have been made in the upper Agúsan,
especially when it was desired to secure the friendship of some more
powerful chieftain. I was informed by a <i>bagáni</i> of the upper Sálug
that it is not an uncommon thing for two warrior chiefs or other
powerful men to make such contracts in order to cement the friendship
between themselves and between their respective clans. He cited several
instances, in some of which the sex of the child proved an impediment to
the carrying out of the prenatal marriage contract. Child marriages,
however, are not uncommon. I know of two cases in Compostela, in one of
which the boy husband was minor, the girl having already attained the
age of puberty at the time of the marriage. In the other case both were
mere children. It is needless to say that cohabitation was not permitted
in the latter case. The marriage payment had been made in the usual way
and the bride delivered over to her father-in-law.</p>

<p>According to my observation, the young man is married somewhere
between the ages of 17 and 20, and the woman from 13 to 16. The effect
of these early marriages is very apparent in the physical appearance of
the wife after a few years of married life. On account of the onerous
duties that fall to the lot of the woman, only a staunch constitution
can maintain unblemished the bloom of youthful beauty. I am of the
opinion that the average woman reaches her prime at about 25 years of
age.</p>

<center>
<a name="3D24"></a>
<h5>POLYGAMY AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS</h5>
</center>

<p>It may be said that the Manóbo is in practice a monogamist, but
polygamy is permitted with the consent of the first wife and, in cases
that I have known, by her direction and even according to her selection.
She finds her work too burdensome and directs her husband to get another
helpmate. As a rule, however, it is only a warrior chief who has more
than one wife, as he is in a better position to procure the wherewithal
to pay the purchase price, namely, slaves. I am acquainted with a number
of warrior chiefs, both Manóbo and Mandáya, who have as many as four
wives, all dwelling in the same house, each having her little
stall<sup>20</sup> and living in perfect peace and happiness with her
sister wives. There appear to be no jealousy and no family broils, the
wish of the first wife being paramount in all things.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup><i>Sin-á-bung</i>.</p>

<p>I found the abhorrence to polyandry so great and so universal that
all tribes that I came in contact with throughout eastern Mindanáo
branded the practice as swinish.</p>

<p>Concubinage is unknown. In a country where a woman is worth a small
fortune to her relatives, and where she can not offer her love according
to her own choice, but must follow her relatives' desires,<sup>21</sup>
it is not likely that she would be delivered over temporarily to even a
warrior chief, nor is she likely to be repudiated except for strong
reasons. Hence divorce is never allowed, as far as my observation and
knowledge go, being considered an infringement of tribal customs that
would provoke divine wrath and bring disaster on the settlement.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>I heard of a case in Guadalupe in which the girl, not
being allowed to marry the man of her choice, took <i>tuble</i> poison
and ended her life.</p>

<p>Among the non-Christianized Manóbos I never heard of a case of
prostitution. The mere suggestion of it would probably result in a fine.
Fornication, however, probably takes place, but only very rarely and
under very abnormal circumstances, as when the sexual temperament of the
girl and a very favorable opportunity encourage the transgression. I
know of cases where Manóbo maidens actually recounted to their relatives
improper suggestions on the part of Bisáyas, and in every case these
relatives, with wild yells, and with menacing movements of bolo and
spear, collected a sufficient compensation to atone for the imprudence.
In one instance I paid the fine imposed upon a half-blind paddler of
mine for a very innocent joke that was not appreciated by the relatives
of a certain woman.</p>

<p>When, however, the Manóbo is removed from the stern influences of his
pagan institutions he goes the way of all flesh, as may be observed by a
study of conditions in <i>conquista</i> towns.</p>

<p>I heard of a few cases of adultery among Christianized Manóbos but,
though the guilty wife was reported to have received a heavy punishment
in the form of a good beating, she was not divorced.</p>

<center>
<a name="3D25"></a>
<h5>ENDOGAMY AND CONSANGUINEOUS MARRIAGES</h5>
</center>

<p>I found no vestige of endogamy nor of the totem system that is such a
remarkable and widespread feature of Polynesian, Melanesian, and cognate
peoples in Oceania. Neither is there any theoretical endogamic
institution which obliges a Manóbo to marry within his tribe, but, in
practice, such is his custom.</p>

<p>The only impediment to marriage is consanguinity. Consanguineous
marriages are everywhere regarded as baneful. It is a universal belief
that unless such marriages are consummated under the special auspices of
the goddesses Ináyao and Tagabáyao, they result in physical evil to both
the parents and the children.</p>

<p>The following are the persons between whom marriage is forbidden:</p>

<blockquote><p>(1) All carnal relatives closer than first cousin.</p>

<p>(2) First, second, and third cousins, unless the proper ceremonies to
Tagabáyao and Ináyao have been performed, various omens very carefully
taken, and, after marriage, the yearly offering of a pig or chicken made
in order to avoid the ill effects that might follow the marriage.</p>

<p>(3) Stepmothers and stepfathers.</p>

<p>(4) Mothers-in-law and fathers-in-law.</p>

<p>(5) Daughters-in-law and sons-in-law.</p>

<p>(6) Captives and their captors. This marriage is believed to bar the
way to warriorship and to otherwise result in evil.<sup>22</sup>
Captives may, however, be married by others than those who captured
them.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup><i>Ma-lí-hi</i>.</p>

<p>(7) Slaves; marriages among them are not tabooed absolutely, but they
are regarded as something unbecoming, and the person who marries a slave
girl is spoken of as <i>áyo-áyo</i> (no good).</p></blockquote>

<p>Marriage with a sister-in-law is fairly common, and may take place
during the wife's lifetime, usually at her instigation, but never
without her consent.</p>

<center>
<a name="3D26"></a>
<h5>INTERTRIBAL AND OTHER MARRIAGES</h5>
</center>

<p>It may be remarked that in the case of marriages between cousins
within the forbidden degrees, the actual marriage payment is much less,
as the matter is considered a family affair, but on the whole such a
marriage is a most expensive affair. In the first place, before the
marriage, the priest instructs the prospective husband to dedicate a
number of objects to Tagabáyao, the goddess of consanguineous love. This
presupposes a sacrificial ceremony in which, as in one case which I
witnessed, a white pig was killed, and a lance valued at P15, a bolo
valued at P10, a dagger valued at P10, and sundry other objects were
formally consecrated to Tagabáyao. The consecration was followed by a
sacrifice to Tagabáyao, after which the marriage payment was made. Then
came a similar series of offerings to Ináyao, goddess of the
thunderbolt, that she might not harm the newly married. I was told that
year after year the newly married cousins had to repeat this ceremony,
and thereby keep in Ináyao's good graces.</p>

<p>Intermarriage with a member of another tribe occurs occasionally but
is not looked upon with favor owing to the differences of religious
belief as also to the fact that it might not be possible for the husband
to take away his wife. In the cases that have come under my notice of
marriages between Manóbos and Mañgguáñgans, Mañgguáñgans and Mandáyas,
and Mandáyas and Manóbos, the man almost invariably married a girl
belonging to what was considered a higher tribe; for instance, Manóbo
man to a Mandáya girl, or a Mañgguáñgan man to a Mandáya girl. The
reason assigned was in nearly every case the assurance that the girl
would not be taken from the paternal roof, and that a bigger marriage
price would be forthcoming.</p>

<p>Gratuitous marriages occur rarely. In the few cases that passed under
my observation, all the expenses of the wedding feast were borne by the
bride's relatives, and the bridegroom took up his residence with his
father-in-law, and virtually entered a state of slavery. His children
also become the property of the father-in-law.</p>

<p>It is not intended to give the impression that the recipient of a
gratuitous wife has to perform the duties of an ordinary slave. On the
contrary, he is treated as one of his wife's family and is expected, in
view of the favor that he has received and the debt that he has
incurred, to help his father-in-law when called upon. If he should
happen on a definite occasion to prove recalcitrant, he is gently
reminded of his debt and of the sacredness with which a good Manóbo pays
it, and so he goes off on his errand and the matter is concluded.</p>

<p>Remarriage takes place frequently, owing to the fact that a widow
does not command so high a price as a maiden and that she has something
to say in the selection of her new husband. She can not, however, be
married if a funeral feast<sup>23</sup> for a near relative of the
family is still unfulfilled.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup><i>Ka-ta-pú-san</i>.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no trace of a levirate system by which the
nearest male kinsman must marry his deceased brother's widow. On the
contrary, a marriage with any relative's widow is absolutely tabooed,
and this taboo, as far as my observations warrant the assertion, is
never violated.</p>

<center>
<a name="3D3"></a>
<h4>MARRIED LIFE AND THE POSITION OF THE WIFE</h4>
</center>

<p>Married life appears to be one of mutual good understanding and
kindliness. The husband addresses his wife as <i>búdyag</i> (wife) and
leaves to her the management of the establishment in everything except
such little business transactions as may have to be carried on. The wife
gets the wood and water every day, toiling up and down the steep
mountain sides. She goes off to the farm once or twice a day and returns
with her basket of <i>camotes</i>. In the meantime the husband whittles
out his bolo sheath or his lance shaft, or occasionally goes off on a
fishing expedition or a hunt, if the omens are good. Every once in
awhile, especially during the winter months, he sets up his wild boar
traps, and they may keep him busy about two days a week. Then comes the
news of a wedding feast, two days' journey hence, and off he goes for
perhaps a week, or there may be a big question to settle in another part
of the country and he must attend the discussion because there is a
relative of his involved; anyhow, it will end up with a big pig and
plenty of brew. So he goes away and has a roaring time, and comes back
after a week with a nice piece of pork and some betel nuts for his wife
and tells her all about the doings. She bears it all, makes her comments
on it, and then goes to get the <i>camotes</i> for dinner, with never a
complaint as to her hard work. It is the custom of the tribe, and the
institution of the great men of bygone days, that the woman should toil
and slave.</p>

<p>I have known of very few domestic broils and have never known of a
case of ill treatment, except when in a drunken fit the husband wreaked
his wrath on his wife.</p>

<p>Faithfulness to the marriage tie is a remarkable trait in Manóboland,
due to the stringent code of morals upheld by the spear and the bolo.
The few cases of adultery related to me among the non-Christian Manóbos
were mere memories. I heard of one case of fornication just before
leaving the upper Agúsan. It was narrated to me by a warrior chief of
the upper Kati'il. His fourth wife, a relative of the <i>datu</i> who
figured in the case of wife capture described in this chapter, had in
the days of her maidenhood secretly fallen from grace, which fact she
revealed to her warrior husband, together with the name of the offender.
The warrior chief thereupon made a two-day march to Compostela and
located the house of his enemy, publicly vowing speedy vengeance. I
visited the latter's house a few days after and found it in a state of
defense, a large clearing having been made, with a mass of felled trees,
underbrush, and bamboo pegs all around. This man was a Manóbo of the
Debabáon group who had spent many years under the tuition of the older
Christians of the Agúsan Valley.</p>

<p>Rape, incest, and other such abominations are practically unheard
of.</p>

<p>From what has been stated frequently throughout this monograph, it
may be seen that the position of the woman is merely that of a chattel.
In moments of anger, which are not frequent, the husband or the
father-in-law addresses the object of his wrath as <i>binótuñg</i>, that
is, purchased one, chattel. A woman, the Manóbo will tell you, has no
<i>tribunal</i>, or <i>tilibuná</i>;<sup>24</sup> she was born to be the
bearer of children and the planter of <i>camotes</i>. She can not carry
a shield nor thrust a spear.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>The meaning is that she has not enough brains to take
part in the discussions held in the town halls, called in Spanish
&#34;tribunal,&#34; and erected by the Spaniards in the various
Christianized settlements for the arbitration of judicial and
administrative matters pertaining to the settlement.</p>

<p>Following out these views to their legitimate conclusions, and both
experience and observation verify them, it is obvious that there is no
evidence of the matriarchate system in Manóbo-land. The husband is the
lord of his household, of his wife, and of his children, and I do not
hesitate to say, probably would abandon or kill either, if the urgency
of a definite occasion required it.<sup>25</sup></p>

<p><sup>25</sup>Maliñgáan of the upper Simúlau, to prevent his wife and
children from falling into the hands of the Spanish forces, slew them
and himself in full view of the soldiery. I found this incident related
in one of the Jesuit letters, to which reference has been made
already.</p>

<center>
<a name="3D4"></a>
<h4>RESIDENCE OF THE SON-IN-LAW AND THE BROTHER-IN-LAW SYSTEM</h4>
</center>

<p>After a few months, dependent on the term determined upon in the
marriage contract, the young husband returns to his father-in-law's
house, to whose family he is now considered to belong, and takes up his
permanent residence there. His respect for both his father-in-law and
mother-in-law is such that he will not mention them by name. He always
addresses them as father-in-law and mother-in-law, respectively. He aids
his father-in-law in everything as a son. Every year for 12 years during
the harvest time he is expected to kill a pig for him. Of course,
occasions arise on which he is called upon by his own relatives and has
to leave his father-in-law. Sometimes it happens that he does not
return, but in such cases he is expected to act in a diplomatic way, and
leave something, say a big pig, as a substitute for his person.</p>

<p>Brothers-in-law, and their name is legion, for the term includes all
who have married any relative however distant, are expected to aid the
relatives of their wives, especially in warfare. And it is my
observation that at least such of them as are married to nearer
relatives of a given individual, do effectively help him when he really
needs either financial or other assistance.</p>

<p>The brothers-in-law of a warrior chief nearly always live with him or
in his immediate vicinity. This custom is maintained, no doubt, both for
the protection and for the prestige thereby acquired.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E"></a>
<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
<h3>DOMESTIC LIFE: PREGNANCY, BIRTH, AND CHILDHOOD</h3>

<a name="3E1"></a>
<h4>DESIRE FOR PROGENY</h4>
</center>

<p>The desire to fulfill the end of marriage is so strong that it may be
said that there is almost rivalry and envy between the young men. Many a
time I have heard the remark made that so and so is <i>a-yo-á-yo</i>--a
sorry specimen of humanity--because he had no children. If you ask a
Manóbo how many children he has he will seldom forget to tell you not
only the number that died, but also the number of times that his wife
suffered miscarriage, owing to a faulty selection of food, or to the
noxious influence of some evil spirits, or to the violation of certain
taboos, or to some other cause.</p>

<p>And thus it is that when the first evidences of motherhood manifest
themselves, the husband procures a <i>white</i> or <i>black</i> chicken
and after inviting a few friends, holds an informal party in honor of
the occasion. I know of one case in which the ritual waving
ceremony<sup>1</sup> took place on pregnancy, but it was performed, so
the husband told me, because of a conjunction of ill omens, and not
because such a ceremony was customary.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Kú-yab to má-nuk</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E2"></a>
<h4>BIRTH AND PREGNANCY TABOOS</h4>
</center>

<p>The precautions taken by both husband and wife during pregnancy, as
also on the approach of parturition, are evidence of the sacredness with
which they guard the dearest hope of their married lives.</p>

<p>The following pregnancy and birth taboos, verified by the writer,
hold with little variation in every part of the Agúsan Valley, and
several of them are still adhered to by the Bisáyas of that
region.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><sup>2</sup>I find that some of these taboos are observed by the
uneducated Tagalogs of Manila and by the peasants of Tayábas
Province.</p>

<p>The general idea prevailing in the observation of these taboos is one
of sympathy by which a certain action, productive of a certain physical
effect in one subject may produce by some sympathetic correlation an
analogous effect in another. An instance will make this clear. To wear a
necklace is an action in itself perfectly innocuous and even beneficial,
in so far as it enhances the person of the wearer, but for the Manóbo
man and wife such a proceeding at this particular time would produce, by
some species of mystic correlation, a binding effect on the child in the
hour of parturition, and must accordingly be eschewed.</p>

<p>These taboos are in force from the time when the young wife announces
her condition until the end of that trying period that follows
conception.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E21"></a>
<h5>TABOOS TO BE OBSERVED BY THE HUSBAND</h5>
</center>

<p>1. He must avoid all untoward acts, such as quarreling and
haggling.</p>

<p>2. His demeanor must be quiet; he must avoid noisy and impetuous
actions, such as taking part in the capture of a domestic pig.</p>

<p>3. He must avoid all heavy work, such as the felling of trees, making
of canoes, or erection of house posts.</p>

<p>4. He must not engage in any work connected with rattan, such as
tying or splicing.</p>

<p>5. He must in no case use resin<sup>3</sup> for the purpose of
sticking handles or shafts on weapons.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Sái-yung</i> or <i>saung</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E22"></a>
<h5>TABOOS TO BE OBSERVED BY THE WIFE</h5>
</center>

<p>1. She must not do any heavy work nor carry anything on her head.</p>

<p>2. She must not sit on a corner of the hearth frame.</p>

<p>3. While in a sitting posture she must leave one knee uncovered.</p>

<p>4. She must be careful in the selection of her food for a period that
seems to depend, according to my observation, on individual whim.</p>

<p>Hence after the inception of pregnancy a woman becomes almost
fastidious in the choice of her food. Her every whim must be catered to.
No general rule can be given, but her general preference is for
vegetable food, especially the core of the various wild palm
trees,<sup>4</sup> plantains, and when obtainable, young coconuts. Acid
fruits, such as the various species of lemons or the fruits of rattan
vines, seem to be her special predilection.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>Ó-bud</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E23"></a>
<h5>TABOOS TO BE OBSERVED BY BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE</h5>
</center>

<p>1. They must not thrust their hands through the floor nor through an
opening in the walls of the house.</p>

<p>2. Anything taken by them from the fire must not be returned by them,
but by a third party.</p>

<p>3. They must not return after having once started to descend the
house ladder until they have reached the ground.</p>

<p>4. They must not sit at the entrance to the house in such a way as to
impede free en trance or exit.</p>

<p>5. They must be careful that the firewood is not unusually speckled
or dirty, as the child that is to come might be lacking in due
comeliness. I have seen many a husband assiduously peeling off the bark
from the more-ugly-looking firewood.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E24"></a>
<h5>TABOOS ENJOINED ON VISITORS</h5>
</center>

<p>Visitors also are cautioned and expected to observe the third and
fourth taboos mentioned under the last section.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p><sup>5</sup>The taboo that forbids a visitor to sit at the door of
the house is observed by the lower classes of Manila. Also the taboo
that forbids quarreling.</p>

<h4>ABORTION</h4>
</center>

<p>Infanticide is never practiced; on the contrary, every means,
natural, magic, and religious, are taken to safeguard the life of the
babe. Abortion, however, occurs.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E31"></a>
<h5>ARTIFICIAL ABORTION</h5>
</center>

<p>Artifical[sic] abortion is unknown among the pagan Manóbos, but the
Christianized members of the tribe who have come under the influence of
culture of a different stamp, have acquired a knowledge of its practice
for the purpose of concealing their condition and of thereby avoiding
subsequent shame and trouble. For this purpose various vegetable
products are used, such as the sap of the red dyewood,<sup>6</sup> the
core of a wild palm,<sup>7</sup> the sap of black dyewood,<sup>8</sup>
and the juice of mint.<sup>9</sup> I was told that these are very
effective and, as a rule, not attended with evil consequences to the
health of the woman.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup><i>Si-ká-lig</i>.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Called <i>báñg-a</i>.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup><i>La-bwé-na</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E32"></a>
<h5>INVOLUNTARY ABORTION</h5>
</center>

<p>Involuntary abortion, however, is a matter of frequent, occurrence.
It would be hard to form an approximate estimate, but, from the opinions
expressed by several warrior chiefs and headmen, I believe that it
occurs not infrequently. No explanation as to its cause was obtained.
The fetus is usually buried without any ceremony under the house. In the
upper Agúsan, the Manóbo follows a Mandáya custom by erecting over the
grave, which is always under the house, an inverted cone of bamboo
slatwork, about 30 centimeters high and 60 centimeters in diameter. The
usual feelings of fright are not displayed on these occasions as on the
death of one that has died an ordinary death, for the child has not yet
been consociated with its two soul companions. Neither is the house
abandoned, as would ordinarily be done on the death of an older
person.</p>

<h4>THE APPROACH OF PARTURITION</h4>

<a name="3E41"></a>
<h5>THE MIDWIFE<sup>10</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>10</sup><i>Pa-na-gám-hon</i>.</p>

<p>About the seventh month when the expectant mother feels the
quickening impulse of life within her, she selects a midwife and
undergoes almost daily at her hands a massage, without which it is
thought she would be in danger of a painful delivery. As far as I could
learn, the method followed is such as to keep the creature in a vertical
position within the womb, with the head downward. The massage is said to
take place at the beginning of a lunar month. The midwife is eminently
the most important personage in all that concerns birth. She is not
necessarily a priestess, but is usually a relative of the prospective
mother. She is always a woman of advanced age who has had abundant
experience, and &#34;has never lost a case.&#34; She is reputed to be
versed in many secret medicines and devices necessary for the cure of
any ailment proceeding from natural causes and connected with
childbirth. I always found the midwife very reluctant to disclose the
secrets of her profession.</p>

<p>When the woman announces the maternal pains, the midwife goes at once
to the house, taking with her various herbs and other things, all
carefully concealed on her person. She is not alone on such occasions,
but is usually accompanied, if not preceded, by the greater portion of
the female population in the community. Few of the male portion, and
none of the bachelors, attend, but they keep themselves informed of the
progress of the patient by frequent yells of inquiry from the
neighboring houses.</p>

<p>The midwife bids the patient lie upon her back and, aided by a few
relatives of the parturient, proceeds to administer one of the most
ferocious massages imaginable. I witnessed one case in which the mother
was tightly bound with swathing clothes and the husband called upon to
exert his strength in an endeavor to force delivery.</p>

<p>As soon as it becomes apparent that the patient is in great pain, the
midwife, and perhaps others expert in such matters, resort to means
which are designed to produce an easy and speedy delivery.</p>

<h5>PRENATAL MAGIC AIDS<sup>11</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>11</sup><i>Ta-gi-á-mo</i>.</p>

<p>During several childbirths which I attended in various parts of the
valley, I observed the use of the following aids to delivery:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. A piece of rattan<sup>12</sup> is taken by one of the
women present and, after being slightly burnt, is extinguished by the
midwife and held close to the person<sup>13</sup> of the parturient.
With her hands the midwife then wafts the smoke over the patient,
muttering at the same time a formula.</p>

<p>The explanation of this procedure, as given to me in all cases, was
the following: The rattan is symbolic of the various fleshy bonds with
which the child is confined within the mother and as the rattan, wound
round and round the various portions of the house, is an impediment to
the removal of the piece which it retains, a piece of it is burnt in
order that by some mystic power the puerperal bonds may be undone.
During the burning the child is exhorted not to resemble the tardy
rattan but to come forth free and untrammeled from its mortal
tenement.</p>

<p>This charm, it was explained to me, counteracts the violations of the
taboos whereby husband or wife, or both, are enjoined not to wear
necklaces or bodily bindings, and not to work in rattan and resin, or to
carry anything on the head. Should the burning of a piece of rattan be
omitted, it is believed that the umbilical cord<sup>14</sup> would be
found to have actually become tangled around the neck or body of the
child during the act of delivery, thereby increasing the difficulty and
the danger.</p>

<p>2. The burning of a small piece of the house ladder<sup>15</sup> and
the subsequent fumigation of the person of the parturient are practiced
in identically the same manner as the above, and are thought to
neutralize the evil effects that might result from the transgressions,
even involuntary, of those taboos which forbid that anyone should sit at
the door of a pregnant woman's house, or return to the house after
having begun his descent down the house pole or ladder.</p>

<p>3. A third magic means, helpful in birth, is the consuming of a
portion of the hearth frame followed, as described above, by a
fumigation of a part of the patient's person. The particular effect of
this charm is to counteract the evil influences which might otherwise
result to the child from the nonobservance of the various other taboos
mentioned previously.</p>

<p>4. Finally, various herbs, of which I did not learn the names because
of secretiveness on the part of the women, are put on a plate or on
anything that is convenient, and burned. On one occasion I observed that
the leaves<sup>16</sup> used to cover sweetpotatoes and other vegetables
during the process of steaming were employed, and on another I procured
a piece of grass that had fallen from the plate and later on I
ascertained it to be the leaf of a variety of bamboo. I was unable to
learn the purpose of this charm, the replies being contradictory or
variable in different localities.</p>

<p>The midwife applies numerous other medicinal herbs and has various
other secret expedients of which I have been utterly unable to learn the
nature. In one case a midwife claimed to have a bezoar
stone<sup>17</sup> found in the body of an eel. This could not be seen,
for it was wrapped in cloth. When the patient gave signs of suffering,
she would dip this stone in water and rub it over the woman's
abdomen.</p></blockquote>

<h5>PRENATAL RELIGIOUS AIDS</h5>
</center>

<p>It is very rarely, indeed, that any serious difficulty is encountered
in childbirth, but I have been informed that difficulties are
occasionally met with. In such cases, when all human resources fail, the
matter is said to be left in the hands of the family priestesses and the
usual religious invocation and rites are performed. In every case one or
more priestesses are present, and take the usual precautions, such as
the placing of lemon and <i>sasá</i> reed under the house, against the
approach of evil spirits.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E5"></a>
<h4>ACCOUCHEMENT AND ENSUING EVENTS</h4>
</center>

<p>The midwife and her companions continue to assist the patient until
the moment of delivery, which takes place ordinarily within from four to
six hours after the first pangs of childbirth have been felt. The
umbilical cord is immediately cut with a sliver<sup>18</sup> of bamboo,
and the mother is made to sit up at once in order to prevent a reflux of
the afterbirth into the womb. At least such is the reason assigned for
this last practice.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup><i>Ba-lís</i>.</p>

<p>The child is immediately washed with water and some medicine
sprinkled over its navel.<sup>19</sup> It is then returned to its
mother. Should the birth have occurred during the period between new and
full moon, it is said that the child will have good luck<sup>20</sup>
during life.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>I was informed on one occasion that the medicine used
was pulverized coconut shell, but this point needs further inquiry.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup><i>Paí-ad</i>.</p>

<p>I desire to call special attention here to the fact that should the
mother be in such a condition that she is unable to nourish her babe, it
is not given to another woman for nurture, but is sustained temporarily
on soup, rice water, and sugarcane juice. I have heard of several cases
in which the child succumbed for want of natural nourishment. One case
that occurred in San Luis on the middle Agúsan, I verified beyond a
doubt. Father Pastells, S. J.,<sup>21</sup> states that if the child can
not be suckled, it is buried alive, its mouth being sometimes filled
with ashes. I, however, have never heard of such a practice.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>Cartas de los PP. de la Compañia de Jesus, 8, 1879.</p>

<p>The reason for allowing no woman other than the mother to nourish the
child is that, if the child were nourished by another woman, it would
die. In this connection it may be well to state that infant mortality is
high. I do not hesitate to say that it is not less than 25 per cent and
may be 33.5 per cent.</p>

<p>The afterbirth, together with the umbilical cord, is nearly always
buried under the house. I was told that it is sometimes wrapped up and
hung from the beams that are just under the hearth. No reason is given
for the selection of this particular place, except that &#34;no one
passes there.&#34;</p>

<center>
<a name="3E6"></a>
<h4>POSTNATAL CUSTOMS</h4>
</center>

<p>As a rule parturition is not attended with much weakness nor with any
danger. In fact, the mother usually can move around the house on the day
following the birth or even on the same day. After two or three days she
purifies herself by an informal bath, which is taken more for sanitary
than for ceremonial reasons, as far as I have been able to ascertain.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E61"></a>
<h5>TABOOS</h5>
</center>

<p>For a period of a week, more or less, the mother must refrain from
the use of all food except the following: The core of the wild palm
tree, native rice, fresh fish, and chicken. The chicken must be of a
certain color; in the lake region of the Agúsan Valley it must be either
black or white, and the leg must be dark in color.</p>

<p>Bathing is interdicted for two or three days according to the custom
of the locality.</p>

<p>After bathing, the new mother and her husband leave the house in
order that the little one may have good luck, and also that they
themselves may be removed from the malign influence of the malevolent
spirits that are inevitably present on the occasion of a birth.</p>

<p>The birth festivity is not a very solemn nor magnificent affair. The
midwife and a few friends, perhaps a dozen in all, are invited. It is at
the end of this repast that some little remuneration is made to the
midwife and to the priestess for their services. Among the pagan Manóbos
there seems to be no fixed rule as to the amount to be given to the
midwife, but among the <i>conquistas</i> or Christianized tribes, there
prevails the customary price of P1.50 for the first birth, P1.00 for the
second, and P0.50 for the third and all successive ones.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E62"></a>
<h5>THE BIRTH CEREMONY<sup>22</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>22</sup><i>Tag-un-ún to bá-ta</i>.</p>

<p>When the child is born it is supposed not yet to have received the
two spirit companions<sup>23</sup> that are to accompany it during its
earthly pilgrimage. Whence proceed these spirit-companions, or what is
their nature, I have not been able to learn to my satisfaction.
<i>Mandáit</i>, the tutelary god of the little ones, after being invoked
and appeased with offerings, is supposed to select two spirit companions
out of the multitudinous beings that hover over human haunts. These
spirits then become guardians, as it were, of the child, and do not
separate themselves from him till one of them becomes the prey of some
foul demon.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup><i>Um-a-gád</i>, from <i>á-gad</i>, to accompany.</p>

<p>These spirit companions are said to be invisible, and in physical
appearance like their corporal companion,<sup>24</sup> whose every
action they are supposed to imitate. As was explained to me, when we sit
down, our spirit companions also sit down, and when we dress, they also
prepare themselves, and when we go forth they accompany us. When the
mother leaves the house with her babe, she adjures the spirits to follow
and to guard their ward. Of the effect and purpose of this consociation
no very definite explanation has so far been given to me.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>In stature they are described as being somewhat
smaller.</p>

<p>The rites of the birth ceremony are observed usually within a month
after the birth. There seems to be no stated time, but according to my
observation and information they take place on the first symptoms of
sickness, or of unusual restlessness on the part of the child. It is
firmly believed and openly avowed that these symptoms are due to the
machinations of Mandáit, who is desirous of being regaled with a fowl,
for he, like all his fellow spirits, is an epicure and likes the good
things of this world.</p>

<p>The ceremony begins with an invocation to Mandáit. A tiny canoe, more
or less perfect in design and equipment, according to the caprice and
skill of the fashioner, is made, and is hung up in the house after
sunset. The nearer relatives assemble and a priest, preferably a
relative, takes the chicken that has already been dedicated<sup>25</sup>
to Mandáit, and waves it over the babe and around the house, in order to
ward off all such bad influences and harmful spirits as might be
flitting around, for in the Manóbo's mind, there are not a few of these
demons waiting to devour the expected spirit companions.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup><i>Sin-ug-bá-han</i>.</p>

<p>The chicken is killed and the head, legs, and wings offered to
Mandáit. To these delicacies are added little leaf packages of cooked
maize<sup>26</sup> or native rice.<sup>27</sup> The priest, on these
occasions invariably a woman, goes through her invocations while the
offerings are being placed on the ceremonial boat. She burns
incense<sup>28</sup> whose fragrance is said to be especially acceptable
to Mandáit. By the direction of the smoke, she ascertains the position
of Mandáit and of her own guardian or familiar spirit, and turning to
him, welcomes him. She falls into the usual state of tremor during which
Mandáit is supposed to partake spiritually of the repast set out for
him.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup><i>Búd-bud</i>.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup><i>Ba-kí</i>.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup><i>Pa-lí-na</i>, the gum of the <i>ma-gu-bái</i>
tree.</p>

<p>This ceremony being concluded, the fowl is partaken of, and a little
sugarcane beverage<sup>29</sup> is drunk, if it can be obtained. After
the meal, the priestess recounts in the old archaic language of song the
chronicles of bygone days. This is taken up by such other makers of
Manóbo monody as may be present. If the child proves to be restless, it
is lulled to sleep with the weird staccato of the bamboo
guitar.<sup>30</sup> During the course of the night the two souls are
supposed to enter into mystic consociation with the babe, and
thenceforth to be its companions.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup><i>Ín-tus</i>.</p>

<p><sup>30</sup><i>Tan-kó</i>.</p>

<p>The following morning the priestess removes the little leaf packages
and, placing them on a rice winnow, tosses them into the air. The
children present at once grab for the packages. The ceremonial canoe,
however, with the offering of fowl, must be left suspended
indefinitely.</p>

<p>In the lower half of the Agúsan Valley from San Luis to the mouth of
the Agúsan, a tray of bamboo trelliswork is used for the offering to
Mandáit instead of the sacrificial canoe described above. Otherwise the
ritual is identical.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E63"></a>
<h5>THE NAMING AND CARE OF THE CHILD</h5>
</center>

<p>The child receives, without any ceremony or formality, a name that
seems to depend on the caprice of the parents. It is usually that of
some famed ancestor, or of some well-known Manóbo but at other times it
may depend on some happening at the birth. Thus the writer knows of
Manóbos who bore the names Bágio (Typhoon), Línug (earthquake), Bádau
(dagger), Bíhag (captive), Áñglañg (slave), Ká-ug (maggot).</p>

<p>The child is treated by the parents and by the other relatives with
the greatest tenderness. He is petted and pampered from his very
youngest days, and punishment of any kind is seldom administered. A
hammock made out of a hemp skirt or a little bamboo frame, suspended by
a string from a bamboo pole in the fishing-rod style, is often provided
for his resting place. He is tenderly set in one of these by day, and
the usual little maternal devices are used to keep him from crying and
to put him to sleep.</p>

<p>When the little fellow is somewhat bigger and stronger, he is carried
about with his legs straddled across his mother's hip, or allowed to
crawl around the floor. If the mother has to absent herself and there is
no one to watch him, he is simply tied to the floor and left to his own
thoughts. He is not weaned till the advent of another child, or till he
of his own accord relinquishes the breast. His dress is of the simplest
in most cases.</p>

<p>As soon as the male child reaches the age of 7 to 8 years, and is
able to run around, he not infrequently accompanies his father or any
other male relative on a fishing or on a hunting expedition, often
carrying the betel-nut bag or some other object at times almost too
heavy for his tender years. While at home he is often in an emergency
sent out to do little chores. He is bidden to run out and get some betel
leaf or some firewood from the surrounding forest, or again is sent
for a little water. Such errands, however, are the exception. He has
most of his time to himself, and passes it in merry rompings with his
little brothers and cousins. If he lives near the river he spends a few
hours a day in the water, bathing, splashing his playmates, and catching
frogs and other edibles. A favorite pastime of his is to make a
diminutive bow and ply his arrows at some old stump or some unlucky
lizard or other living thing that he may have espied. If monkeys, crows,
or other bold marauders are overnumerous, he probably has to sit out in
the rude watch-house in the little clearing and keep the scarecrows
moving, or by shouts and other means drive off the uninvited pests.</p>

<p>He soon learns to smoke tobacco, to chew betel nut, and even to take
a drink of the brew that is being passed around, and thus he grows up to
be, at the age of 14 or 15, a little full-fledged man with his teeth
blackened, his lips stained, and his bolo at his side.</p>

<p>He enters youth without any special ceremony. It is true that as the
boy grows to puberty his teeth are ground and blackened and he is
tatooed[sic] and circumcised. Such operations might be considered as an
initiation into manhood or at least as a survival of a custom that is so
much in vogue in certain parts of Oceania. In other words, the youth
begins to tattoo and to assume other ornamentation in order that he may
attract the attention of the female portion of the tribe.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that he receives no schooling. In fact, the
average Manóbo who has not come in contact with civilization would not
know what to think of a pencil. On one occasion I accidentally allowed
some Manóbos to see my pencil. The sight of it aroused an animated
discussion as to the nature of the tree that yielded such peculiar wood.
All the schooling which the Manóbo boy gets is from the forest and the
streams. From them he learns to trap the timid deer and to catch the
wily fish. In them he acquires a quick step, a sharp eye, and a keen
ear. In the ways of nature he is a scholar, because the first moment
that he can clamber down the notched pole he betakes himself to the
surrounding forest and schools himself in all her ways and moods.</p>

<p>As soon as the boy reaches the age at which he feels that he is a
man, he ceases to be under paternal restraint, which even up to that age
has been more or less lax. At this period he assumes as much
independence as his father, but will obey any behest without
understanding the propriety or the necessity of complying. As a general
rule, filial relations are most cordial, and great respect is
entertained for both parents, but it may be said that male children
respect and love the father, while girls love their mother.</p>

<h4>BIRTH ANOMALIES</h4>

<a name="3E71"></a>
<h5>MONSTROSITIES</h5>
</center>

<p>Monstrosities are extremely rare. I met only one case, that of a
child with an abnormally large head.<sup>31</sup> Idiocy also is very
uncommon, only one case having come under my observation.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup>Bása, Simúlao River, middle Agúsan.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E72"></a>
<h5>ALBINISM</h5>
</center>

<p>Albinism also is very infrequent. An albino is considered to be the
child of an evil spirit in so far as one of those relentless demons is
supposed to have exercised a malign influence on the mother. It is
believed that an albino can pay nightly visits to the haunt of its demon
sire. Among the Mandáyas on the upper Kati'il River, I saw some 12 cases
of albinism in a settlement of about 500 Mandáyas. No explanation was
obtained as I did not think it prudent at the time to ask for one.</p>

<center>
<a name="3E73"></a>
<h5>HERMAPHRODITISM</h5>
</center>

<p>Hermaphrodites,<sup>32</sup> in a secondary sense, are found
occasionally. I am personally acquainted with five. In every case they
were womanly in their ways, showing a preference for sewing, and other
occupations of women, and frequenting the company of women more than
that of men.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup><i>Bán-tut</i> (Mandáya <i>bi-dó</i>).</p>

<p>In one case at San Isidro, Simúlao River, an hermaphrodite, a fine
specimen of manhood to all appearances, was dressed as a woman. In
another case a Mandáya hermaphrodite of the Báklug River, a few miles
south of Compostela, was married. I was informed on all hands that the
marriage was for the purpose of securing the alliance of the
hermaphrodite's relatives against certain hereditary enemies and that
probably there would be no issue. I hope to get further information on
this point at a future date.</p>

<p>On the Lamíñga River, a tributary of the Kasilaían River, there lived
a woman who presented all the outward characteristics of a man. Her
voice was deep and resonant, her countenance of a male type. She
constantly carried a bolo, by day and by night, and in manual labor,
such as building houses, was the equal of any man in the settlement. She
had never married and had always rejected overtures toward marriage.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>
<h3>DOMESTIC LIFE--MEDICINE, SICKNESS, AND DEATH</h3>

<a name="3F1"></a>
<h4>MEDICINE AND DISEASE</h4>
</center>

<p>The subject of Manóbo medicine may be divided into three parts,
according to the causes that are supposed to produce the malady or
according to the means that are used to cure it. These classes will be
described as natural, magic, and religious.</p>

<center>
<a name="3F11"></a>
<h5>NATURAL MEDICINES AND DISEASES</h5>
</center>

<p>Natural remedies in the form of roots and herbs are used for the
ordinary bodily ailments that afflict the Manóbo. The following are the
more common forms of sickness: Fever,<sup>1</sup>
tuberculosis,<sup>2</sup> pain in the diaphragm,<sup>3</sup> pains in
the stomach and abdomen,<sup>4</sup> pains in the chest,<sup>5</sup>
pain in the head,<sup>6</sup> colds,<sup>7</sup> chronic cough (probably
bronchitis),<sup>8</sup> pernicious malaria,<sup>9</sup> ordinary
malaria or chills and fever,<sup>10</sup> cutaneous
diseases,<sup>11</sup> intestinal worms,<sup>12</sup> and some few
others.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Híñg-yau</i>.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>Súg-pa</i>.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Ka-bú-hi</i>, or <i>gi-húb</i>, probably a reversal of
the diaphragm.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>Pús-on</i> and <i>go-túk</i>.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup><i>Da-gá-ha</i>.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup><i>Ó-yo</i>.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>U-bó</i>.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Pás-mo</i>.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup><i>Pid-pid</i>.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup><i>Ó-yud</i>.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup><i>Ká-do</i>.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Bí-tuk</i>.</p>

<p>The natural remedies used in the cure of the above-mentioned diseases
are not very numerous, but they are applied as a rule externally. In
each settlement there are always a few who have gained a reputation
above others for their knowledge of these medicines, but their
proficiency is not high as may be judged by the degree of their success
and by the opinion of many of their fellow tribesmen.</p>

<p>For wounds, tobacco juice and the black residue found in a tobacco
pipe are considered an effective ointment. Saliva mixed with betel nut
is used for the same purpose, and also for pains in the stomach. For
other pains the leaves of various trees, according to the knowledge or
faith of each individual, are applied. For pains in the stomach the gall
of a certain snake<sup>13</sup> is said to be efficacious. It is mixed
with a little water and applied externally, or it may be taken
internally, provided it be mixed with a little powder from a piece of
pulverized plate.<sup>14</sup></p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Ba-ku-sán</i>. The gall of this snake is reported as
being a panacea used by the Mamánuas.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup><i>Píñg-gan</i>, an imported plate of very inferior
make.</p>

<p>The perfume of certain resins and especially that of the
<i>manumbá</i> tree are considered medicinal in some cases.</p>

<p>The root of a tree called <i>lú-na</i> when left to steep in water,
is said to be a very potent remedy for pains in the stomach. The seed of
the <i>sá-i</i> grass is also used for the same purpose, and is said to
be a prophylactic against stomach troubles.</p>

<p>No amount of persuasion will overcome the Manóbos' suspicions of
European medicine till the administrator of it follows the old saying of
&#34;Physician, heal thyself,&#34; and takes the first dose. In any case
it is not prudent to offer it except after long acquaintance, for should
any change for the worse occur in the patient's condition after taking
the foreign medicine he might imitate people of greater intellectual
caliber, and say, as he probably would, &#34;Post hoc, ergo propter
hoc,&#34; and the ensuing events might be sudden and unexpected.</p>

<p>On one occasion I administered a small dose of quinine to a child
that was suffering from fever. It died the following day. The father,
who had requested me to give the child some medicine, through the medium
of a Mañgguáñgan, sent me a few days later a present of a chicken and
about two glassfuls of sugarcane brew, and would not accept a
reciprocatory gift of beads and jingle bells that I sent him. The
chicken and the beverage were partaken of in due time, each of my
servants drinking about half a glass of the liquor. The following
morning at about 4 o'clock I awoke with a sense of impending death. The
servants were called and they, too, complained of an uneasy feeling and
one of them suggested that we might have been poisoned. A dose of
ipecacuanha saved our lives, and at about 9 o'clock I proceeded to look
for the bearer of the gift, but was unable to locate him, as he had gone
to his forest home. A diplomatic investigation revealed the fact that he
was an expert in poisons and that the poison administered to me in the
liquor was probably the root of the <i>túbli</i> vine that is also used
for poisoning fish.</p>

<p>Fragrant flowers and redolent seeds and herbs are thought to be very
efficacious for the relief of headaches, fainting spells, and for the
peculiar diaphragm trouble referred to before. The resin of the
<i>magubái</i> tree, which also is used as incense in ceremonial rites,
is considered very potent. I have frequently seen patients held over the
smoke till I thought that death by suffocation would result.</p>

<p>In fine, it may be said that the Manóbos' knowledge of medicinal
plants is very limited, and his application of them equally so, for as
soon as he thinks that the condition of the patient has changed for the
worse the malady is at once attributed to preternatural causes, and
corresponding remedies are resorted to.</p>

<p>On casual observation it might appear that the sick are neglected,
but this is not the case. The relatives, especially the womenfolk,
display the tenderest solicitude toward them and keep them provided with
an abundance of food. The lack of blankets leaves the patient exposed to
the inequalities of temperature and explains, no doubt, the frequent
occurrence of colds, of rheumatism, and sometimes of tuberculosis. This
also may account for the high death rate among children.</p>

<h5>MAGIC AILMENTS AND MEANS OF PRODUCING THEM</h5>
</center>

<p>It is a common thing to hear that a <i>kometán</i> was the cause of a
person's death. This may be defined as a secret method by which death is
superinduced in a certain person by means either supposedly magic in
character or so secret in administration that they may be looked upon as
magic. Thus (to give an example of a purely magical sickness), it is
thought that by making a wooden mannikin to represent the victim and by
mistreating it the person whom it represents will immediately fall sick
and die unless countervailing methods are employed to neutralize the
effects of the charm. I heard of a case in the lower Agúsan near
Esperanza where a wooden figure was made to represent the person of a
thief. The figure was cruelly tortured by sticking a bolo into its head,
and when sufficient punishment had been administered to cause its death,
had it been a thing of life, it was buried amid much wailing. I was
assured that the party whom it represented was taken with a lingering
disease shortly afterwards and finally died.</p>

<p>The belief in the <i>kometán</i> or secret means of superinducing
sickness is widespread, but it is difficult to obtain reliable data on
the subject because, for obvious reasons, no one will admit that he is
acquainted with the secret nor will he affirm that anyone else is unless
it be a person so far away that there is no danger of future
complications by reason of the imputation.</p>

<center>
<a name="3F13"></a>
<h5>THE COMPOSITION OF A FEW "KOMETÁN"</h5>
</center>

<p>1. The fine flossy spiculæ of a species of bamboo<sup>15</sup> placed
in the food or in the drink is supposed to cause a slow, lingering
sickness that ends in death.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup><i>Caña bojo</i>, or bamboo of the genus
<i>Schizostachyum</i>.</p>

<p>2. A piece of a dead man's bone pulverized and put into the food,
even into the betel-nut quid, is said to have the same effect but in a
more expeditious way, as it superinduces death within a few months.</p>

<p>3. Another reported <i>kometán</i> consists of the blood of a woman
dried in the sun and exposed to the light of the moon. This is mixed
with human hair cut very fine. Administered in the food, it produces a
slow lingering disease that leads to the grave. It is said that after
death the hair reappears resting upon the lips and nostrils.</p>

<p>4. Human hair mixed with bits of fingernails and powdered glass is
said to be especially virulent. The secret of compounding it is known
only to a few. I was informed that the knowledge of this secret
composition was acquired from Bisáyas.<sup>16</sup></p>

<p><sup>16</sup>It is called <i>pa-ágai</i>.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the war chiefs are provided with
antidotes<sup>17</sup> against the <i>kometán</i>. In fact, several
assured me that they possessed them, but they were unwilling to enter
into any details. I once saw a little bottleful of strange-looking herbs
and water sold for P2.50. It was said to be an antidote against the
particular species of <i>kometán</i>, which, on being placed in the
path, would affect the one for whom it was intended when he passed the
spot.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup><i>Súm-pa</i>.</p>

<p>A piece of lodestone,<sup>18</sup> or even an ordinary toy magnet, is
thought, in certain localities, to act as a safeguard against divers
kinds of evil charms.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup><i>Bá-to bá-ni</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3F14"></a>
<h5>OTHER MAGIC MEANS</h5>
</center>

<p>I found a prevalent belief in the existence of an
<i>aphrodisiac</i><sup>19</sup> which is said to consist of wax made by
a small insect called <i>kí-ut</i>, and of the ashes of various trees.
The secret of compounding it is known to very few. There is a persistent
rumor that this was first learned from the Mamánuas,<sup>20</sup> who
are supposed to be very proficient in the making and use of it even to
this day. If a little of the composition is put on the dress of a woman,
or, better still, if a little packet of it is attached to her girdle
charms she will become attached to the man who placed it there and will
aid him, as far as it can be done, in his suit for her hand.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>Called <i>hu-pai</i>.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>It is strange that the more advanced tribes in eastern
Mindanáo attribute a knowledge of magic methods to inferior ones. I have
been informed that both Mamánuas and Mañgguáñgans are more expert in the
manufacture and administration of charms than other tribes.</p>

<p>There is also a charm which is said to produce an aversion or dislike
between those who had formerly been friends.</p>

<p>Bezoar stones are hard substances, of a dark color, and vary in size
from a pea to a chestnut. They are said to be found in various trees and
plants,<sup>21</sup> and animals and fishes such as the monkey and
eel.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>Such as the <i>a-nís-lag</i>, the <i>tú-ba</i>, the
<i>túb-li</i>.</p>

<p>Their properties are both medicinal and magic. Thus the bezoar stones
from three different plants are supposed to be efficacious in the hour
of birth, but, at the same time, in all the doings of life they give the
fortunate possessor success over his rival. Hence they are called
<i>pandáug</i>, that is, they will enable one to get ahead of or beat
another. There is a bezoar stone from the <i>banti</i> tree that gets
its owner to a place more quickly than his rival.</p>

<h5>BODILY AILMENTS PROCEEDING FROM SUPERNATURAL CAUSES</h5>
</center>

<a name="3F151"></a>
<p><i>Sickness due to capture of the soul by an inimical
spirit</i>.--When a malady is of such a nature that it can not be
diagnosed, or of so serious a character that fear is entertained for the
recovery of the patient, it is ascribed to the maleficence of evil
spirits, and supernatural means are resorted to in order to save the
captured soul from their spirit clutches. For this purpose the priest
intercedes with his divine tutelars, and prevails upon them, by
offerings and promises, to rescue the captive. If the ailment is
attributed to the war divinities, then the warrior chief becomes the
officiant and, after appeasing the angry spirit with a blood offering,
secures the release of the unfortunate soul.</p>

<a name="3F152"></a>
<p><i>Epidemics attributed to the malignancy of sea
demons</i>.--Epidemics of cholera and smallpox are thought to be due
directly to evil spirits who bring the diseases from their faraway sea
haunts.</p>

<p>It is said that friendly deities and war spirits of the settlement
announce from the lofty mountain heights the approach of these
pestiferous demons. Thus, I was assured by many in the Kasilaían River
district, that Mount Tatamba on a tributary of the Lamiñga River gave
out a loud booming noise before the epidemic of 1903-4. The same is said
of Mount <i>Mag-diuáta</i> by the Súlibao people. Be that as it may,
those who live along the main rivers scurry away on the approach of
contagion into the depths of the forest or upon the heights of the
mountains, and do not return until they feel assured that all danger is
past. I was a personal witness of this among the upper Agúsan Manóbos,
where I found a settlement, more than one year after the appearance of a
contagious disease, still ensconced in the heart of the forest a few
miles away from all water.<sup>22</sup></p>

<p><sup>22</sup>The inhabitants lived on the water that exuded from a
tree known as <i>ba-sí-kung</i>.</p>

<p>The reason given for avoiding the larger watercourses during
epidemics is that streams are thought to be the high roads for the sea
demons when they come upon their work of destruction. There were never
wanting some in each settlement who had seen these demons under some
monstrous form or other.</p>

<a name="3F153"></a>
<p><i>Propitiation of the demons of contagious diseases</i>.--Besides
such offerings as may be made to them during the regular ritual, there
is a special method of propitiating these plague bearers and thereby of
inducing them to betake themselves whither they hailed.</p>

<p>A raftlet<sup>23</sup> is made of bamboo, with a platform of the same
material raised several inches above the surface of the craft. This is
adorned with palm fronds arched over it. Upon it is firmly lashed a
young pig or a large fowl, of a white color, and by its side are placed
various other offerings of betel nut, rice, or eggs, according to the
bounty and good will of the priest and of the settlement. When all is
ready, it is taken to the water's edge about sunset, for that is the
hour when the mightiest of the demons begin their destructive march.
Here the priest makes an address to the demon of the epidemic,
descanting on the value of the offerings, the scarcity of victims at
that particular time, the reasons for mutual friendship between him (the
demon) and the settlement. The demon is then requested to accept these
tokens of good will and to go his seaward way. The disease itself,
though never mentioned by name, is requested in the same manner to take
passage upon the raft and to accompany its master downstream. The raft
is then launched into the water and allowed to follow the will of the
current. No one may even touch it or approach it on its downward course,
for it has become foul by contact with its pestilential
owners.<sup>24</sup></p>

<p><sup>23</sup><i>Gá-kit</i>.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>Bisáyas have no scruples in appropriating the fat fowls
and pigs thus found floating to doom.</p>

<h4>SICKNESS AND DEATH</h4>

<a name="3F21"></a>
<h5>THE THEORY OF DEATH</h5>
</center>

<p>Except in the case of a warrior chief, or a priest, or one who has
met his end at the hands of an enemy, death is ordinarily attributed to
the maleficence of the inimical spirits. The latter are believed to be
relentless, insatiable demons &#34;seeking whom they may devour.&#34; In
some mysterious manner they are said to waylay a poor defenseless soul,
and ruthlessly hold it in captivity till such time as it suits their
whims, when they actually devour it. Notwithstanding the numerous
explanations given to me throughout the Agúsan Valley, I have never been
able to satisfy myself as to the various circumstances of time, place,
and manner in which the capture and consumption of the soul takes place.
Suffice it to say, however, that in its essential points this is the
universal belief: One of the soul companions is seized, and the owner
falls sick. Every available means is tried to effect a cure. When
everything fails the priest declares that the ailment is due, not to any
natural infirmity, but to the capture or wounding of one of the souls of
the patient by inimical spirits. Sacrifices are ordered, during which
usually a large number (from four to eight) of priests of both sexes
invoke their various divinities and beseech them to rescue the spirit
companion of the patient. During these ceremonies the priests describe
minutely how the capture was effected. In lengthy chants they set forth
the efforts of their deities to find the missing soul; they describe how
they travel to the ends of the sky, seeking the cruel captors and vowing
vengence[sic] upon their heads. They are said to make use of an
<i>espiho</i><sup>25</sup> to discover the whereabouts of the enemy and
of the captive. The recapture of the soul and frequently the mighty
encounter between the good and bad spirits is chanted out at length by
the priests. I was told that in some cases the rescued soul is taken to
the home of the deities and there consoled with feast and dance and song
before its return to its earthly companion.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup>This <i>es-pi-ho</i> (from Spanish <i>espejo</i>, a
looking-glass) is some kind of a wonderful telescope by which objects
can be described at the farther extremities of the firmament. No lurking
place is so remote or so secret as to be hidden from its marvelous
power.</p>

<center>
<a name="3F22"></a>
<h5>FEAR OF THE DEAD AND OF THE DEATH SPIRITS</h5>
</center>

<p>The utter fear, not only of the malignant spirits but also of the
person of the dead and of his soul, is one of the most peculiar features
of Manóbo culture. In the death chamber and hovering around the resting
place of the dead there is a certain noxious influence<sup>26</sup> by
the infection of which one is liable to become an object of attraction
to the dark-visaged, hungry, soul ghouls that, lured by the odor, stalk
to the death house and await an opportunity to secure a victim.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup><i>Bá-ho</i>.</p>

<p>Then, again, the envious spirits of the dead are feared, for they, in
their eagerness to participate in the farewell and final death feast,
avail themselves of every occasion to injure the living in some
mysterious but material way. Sickness, especially one in which the only
symptoms are emaciation and debility, are attributed to their noxious
influence. Failure of the crops, bodily accidents, want of success in
important undertakings--these and a thousand and one other things--are
attributed to a lack of proper attention to the envious dead. &#34;You
have been affected by an <i>umagad</i>,&#34;<sup>27</sup> is a common
saying to express the peculiar effect that the departed may cause on the
living. To avert this unkindly feeling and thereby prevent the evil
consequences of it, it is not an infrequent thing to see propitiatory
offerings made to the departed in the shape of betel nut, chickens, and
other things. In one instance the father of a child that had died,
presumptively from eating new rice, imposed upon himself an abstinence
from that article for a period of several months.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup><i>In-um-a-gád ka</i>.</p>

<p>As another evidence of fear of the departed souls may be cited the
unwillingness of the Manóbo to use anything that belonged to the dead,
such as clothes. An exception, however, is made in the case of weapons
and other heirlooms,<sup>28</sup> all of which have been consecrated and
are supposed not to retain the odor or evil influence of death.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup><i>Án-ka</i>.</p>

<p>Offerings made to the dead to appease their ill will are not partaken
of by the living. They are supposed to produce baneful
effects.<sup>29</sup> Hence they are carefully removed to the outside of
the house after the departed visitor is supposed to have regaled
himself. This applies to betel-nut offerings, and to such offerings as
chickens and pigs that in cases of unusual pestering on the part of the
dead may be set out with a view to propitiating them.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup><i>Ka-dú-ut</i>.</p>

<p>One or more priests are present invariably in the death chamber. The
female priests take up their position near the corpse, and by the use of
lemons, pieces of the <i>sa-sá</i> reed, and other things, said to be
feared by the demons, protect themselves and those present. Hence,
during the average &#34;wake&#34; the womenfolk huddle around the
priestesses with many a startled glance. On one occasion I saw a male
priest take up his stand at the door, lance poised, ready to dispatch
such spirits as might dare to intrude into the death chamber. Drums and
gongs are beaten throughout the night, not merely as a distraction for
their grief but as a menace to the ever-present demons.</p>

<p>An acquaintance of mine in San Luis, middle Agúsan, is reported to
have wounded seven evil spirits in one evening on the occasion of a
death. I was assured by many in the town that they had seen the gory
lance after each encounter.</p>

<p>Several other precautions besides those mentioned above are taken to
secure immunity from the stealthy attacks of the demons. A fire is kept
burning under the house, and the usual magic impediments, such as
<i>sa-sá</i> reed, lemons, and a piece of iron, are placed underneath
the floor as menace to these insatiate spirits. Moreover, the food while
still in the process of cooking is never left unguarded, lest some
malicious spirit should slyly insert therein poison wherewith to kill
his intended victim or to spirit away an unwary soul.</p>

<p>For several days both before and after the death, supper is almost
invariably partaken of before sunset, as this is the hour when the most
mighty of the demons are supposed to go forth on their career of
devastation. If, however, it should be necessary to take supper after
sunset, it is the invariable custom to put a mat on the floor and
thereby foil the stealthy spirits in their endeavors to slip some
baneful influence<sup>30</sup> into the plates from below.</p>

<p><sup>30</sup>This custom is prevalent among many of the Bisáyas of
eastern Mindanáo and may perhaps explain the origin of the peculiar low
table used by them.</p>

<p>After the burial it is almost an invariable rule for the inmates of a
house to abandon it. This remark, however, does not hold good in the
case of the decease of priests, warrior chiefs, and children, nor in the
case of those who have been slain in war. Should a stranger, or one who
is not a relative of the inmates, die in the house, it is an established
custom to collect the value of the house from the relatives of the
deceased. Father Pastells in one of the &#34;Cartas de los PP. de la
Compañía de Jesús&#34; cites an incident that happened to him in the
house of Selúñgan on the upper Sálug in the year 1878. It seems that one
of Pastells' followers died and that Selúñgan desired to collect the
value of the house. I know of one case where the fine was actually
collected. I was asked by a warrior chief on the upper Tágo, who would
pay for the house in the case of my death.</p>

<center>
<a name="3F23"></a>
<h5>INCIDENTS ACCOMPANYING DEATHS</h5>
</center>

<p>When death ensues, the relatives burst forth into loud wails of
grief. In one death scene that I witnessed the wife of the deceased fell
down on the floor, and in the wildness of her grief kept striking her
head against the <i>palma brava</i> slats until she rendered herself
unconscious. Upon returning to herself, she violently embraced the
corpse of her deceased husband, bidding him return. Then she broke out
into loud imprecations against her tutelary deities upbraiding them for
their ingratitude in not having saved her husband's soul from the
clutches of its enemies. She bade them be off, would have no more to do
with them, and finally ended up by bidding them go on the war trail and
destroy the foul spirits that deprived her of her husband.</p>

<p>In nearly every death scene that I witnessed this last procedure was
the ordinary one, and I may say that it is quite characteristic of the
Manóbo.</p>

<p>On several occasions I witnessed some fierce displays of fury, to
which the mourners were driven by their poignant grief for some beloved
relative. In one instance the father of the deceased, drawing his bolo,
started to hack down one of the house posts, and in another the son,
after a frantic outburst of grief, seizing his shield and lance,
declared that he would ease his sorrow in the joy of victory over his
enemies and actually had to be detained by his relatives.</p>

<p>The grief and fury felt on these occasions will readily explain the
frequency of war raids after the occurrence of a death. This was
explained to me by Líno of the upper Sálug, probably the greatest
warrior of eastern Mindanáo, in the following manner: &#34;After the
decease of a near relative, our enemies will rejoice and may, as is done
with frequency, proclaim their joy. We do not feel in good humor anyhow,
so, if it can be arranged speedily, we start off to assuage the sorrow
of our friends and our relatives with the palms of triumph.&#34;</p>

<p>This statement of Líno may explain the origin of the taboo that is
observed throughout the Agúsan Valley. The taboo referred to prohibits
anyone except a near relative from visiting the house of the deceased
for seven days after the death. It is suggested that this custom was
instituted to prevent the enemy from learning whether an expedition was
being set afoot. To enforce compliance with this custom, the trails
leading to the house are closed by putting a few branches across them at
a short distance from the house. It is not infrequent to find a broken
jar suspended (or placed) at these points, symbolic, probably, of the
cruel fate that may overtake the transgressor. Infringements of this
taboo are punished with a fine that varies from P5 to P15.</p>

<center>
<a name="3F24"></a>
<h5>PREPARATION OF THE CORPSE</h5>
</center>

<p>After the first paroxysm of grief has subsided, the body of the
deceased is washed, the greatest delicacy in exposing the person being
shown, and it is then attired in the finest garments obtainable. No
personal ornaments, such as necklaces and bracelets, are removed. Charms
and talismans, however, are removed, being considered heirlooms. The
corpse is then laid on its back, with the hands lying at the side, in
the rude coffin.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that, in the olden days, the bolo of the
deceased used to be buried with him but I never saw this done. The bolo,
however, was placed by his side in a few cases that I witnessed. Among
the mountain Manóbos there exists the custom of winding strands of
colored cotton on the fingers and feet of young girls and maidens after
death. I witnessed this in the upper Agúsan, and, in answer to my
inquiry, was informed that such was the custom of the Agusánon
people.</p>

<p>The coffin is a hexagonal receptacle hewn out of a log,<sup>31</sup>
and provided with a truncated prism lid of the same wood. It frequently
has a few ornamental tracings of soot or other pigment, and where
European cloth is procurable a few pieces may be employed as a wrapping.
The corpse is wrapped in a mat and laid in the coffin, the head being
placed upon a rude pillow of wood. The coffin is then firmly lashed with
rattan and is not removed till the hour for interment. Frequently
lemons, <i>sá-i</i> grass, and various other redolent herbs are placed
on or near it with a view, I was told, to repressing the odor of the
dead. It is probable, however, that they are thought to have magic or
other virtues. They certainly are objects of fear to the death
demons.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup><i>A-yu-yao</i>, said to be very durable, being found in
perfect preservation after two years; <i>kibidid</i> or
<i>ilang-ilang</i> are also used.</p>

<p>The wailing, weird and wild, of the women was violent in nearly every
case I witnessed, especially when the corpse was taken out of the house
on its way to the burial place. The grief displayed by the male
relatives is not so intense but I noticed frequently that even they
broke into tears. I may add here that I was often informed that the
absence of the outward signs of grief is an infallible evidence of a
speedy death, and that it is considered unlucky to allow one's tears to
fall on the corpse.</p>

<p>Before describing the burial, I desire to mention a peculiar
proceeding which I observed on one occasion.<sup>32</sup> Before the
corpse had been placed in the coffin, one of those present, seizing a
dog, placed it transversely on the breast of the deceased for a few
seconds. I was told that the object of the action was to remove the
dog's bad luck<sup>33</sup> by putting him in the above-mentioned
position, as he had for some time been rather unlucky in the chase. This
proceeding was verified by subsequent inquiries in other settlements,
and the custom and its explanation were found to be identical with the
above mentioned.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup>San Luis, 1906.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup><i>Pá-yad</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3F25"></a>
<h5>THE FUNERAL</h5>
</center>

<p>As a rule the burial takes place the morning after the death, unless
the death occurred during the night, in which case it takes place the
following afternoon. Decomposition is never allowed to set in.</p>

<p>When all is ready, a last tribute and farewell are paid to the
deceased. The family priest sets an offering of betel nut near the
coffin, beseeching the dead one to depart in peace and bear no ill will
to the living. He promises at the same time that the mortuary
feast<sup>34</sup> will be prepared with all possible speed. The
deceased is addressed, usually by several relatives and friends who wish
him well in his new home and repeat the invitation to come to the death
feast and bring grandfather and grandmother and all other relatives that
had preceded him to the land of Ibú.</p>

<p><sup>34</sup><i>Ka-ta-pús-an</i>.</p>

<p>Then, amid great wailing, the coffin is borne away hastily. Only men
assist at the burial, and as a rule a male priest, sometimes several,
accompany the funeral party in order to assist them against the evil
ones that throng to the grave. The priests take up their positions, as I
witnessed on several occasions, at strategic points behind trees, with
balanced lance and not infrequently with shield. I have seen others
provided with <i>sa-sá</i> reed in anticipation of wounding some
over-bold spirits.</p>

<p>I observed a very peculiar custom on several occasions. On the way to
the grave the men indulged in wild shouts. No other explanation was
offered except that such was the custom. It was suggested, however, that
it is a means of driving off the demons who may have got the scent of
death, or, again, it may be to warn travelers that there is a funeral,
thus enabling them to avoid meeting it, as this is said to be most
unlucky.</p>

<p>I have heard of the dead being buried under the house. However, the
practice is infrequent and is usually followed at the request of the
dying one. It is needless to add that the house and neighboring crops
are abandoned. When possible a high piece of ground is selected in the
very heart of the forest and a small clearing is made. The work at the
grave is apportioned without much parleying, some of the men devoting
themselves to making the customary roof<sup>35</sup> to be placed over
the grave, while others do the excavating. Sometimes a fence is erected
around the burying ground. The work always proceeds in absolute silence,
and a fire is always kept burning as a menace to the evil spirits. When
all is ready, the coffin is laid in its resting place and covered in all
haste. Here it may be remarked with regard to the orientation of the
corpse, that men are buried with their feet toward the east and women
with their feet toward the west. Then the little roof is set upon four
supports about 45 centimeters above the grave. One of those present,
sometimes a priest, lays a plate with seven offerings of betel nut upon
the grave. Then an earthen pot<sup>36</sup> with its collation of boiled
rice<sup>37</sup> and with a hole broken in the bottom of it is hung up
under the roof.</p>

<p><sup>35</sup><i>Bin-aí-iu</i>.</p>

<p><sup>36</sup><i>Kó-don</i>.</p>

<p><sup>37</sup>Imported rice can not be used.</p>

<p>As explained to me, rice is intended as a last refection for the
departed one before he sets out on his journey to the land of Ibú. The
hole that is invariably made in the bottom is intended, so I was told by
many, to facilitate the consumption of the rice. The family heirlooms
are occasionally brought to the grave but are not left there.</p>

<p>There is a common tradition to the effect that the ancient mode of
sepulture was a more pompous and solemn affair than the present one. I
was told that the deceased was buried with all his personal arms, except
his lance and shield, which were laid over his grave. Sacred
jars<sup>38</sup> were also left. I never have been able to get
sufficient information as to the exact whereabouts of the old burial
grounds. The cave of Tinágo near Taganáan, about 12 miles south of
Surigáo, is easily accessible. The Bisáyas of the town state that it was
a burial place for the ancient Bisáyas, but Montano, who procured some
skulls from this cave, pronounced it to be a Manóbo cemetery. The fact
is, however, that up to this day the townspeople repair to the cave on
occasions and invoke their ancestors. I was told of one gambler who used
to go there and burn a candle in order to increase his luck.</p>

<p><sup>38</sup><i>Ba-hán-di</i>.</p>

<p>The mourners carefully efface the footprints that have been made by
them on the loose clay around the grave and, scurrying away sadly and
silently, leave the dead one in the company of the spirits of darkness.
Henceforth this, the resting place of one who was beloved in life,
possibly of a loving wife, or of a darling child, will be eschewed as a
place of terror where stalk with silent footfall and dark-visaged face
the foul and insatiate soul ghouls.</p>

<p>On arriving at the house whence they started, the funeral party
invariably find a vessel, usually a coconut-shell cup, containing a
mixture of water and herbs,<sup>39</sup> placed at the door of the
house. Each one in turn wets his hands and purifies himself by rubbing
the water on some portion of his body. I never saw this process omitted.
The explanation afforded me was that the water had a
purificatory<sup>40</sup> effect in removing the evil influence to which
they had become susceptible by contact with the dead. After the burial,
a little repast is set out by way of compensation for those who assisted
at the burial, and then begins the time of mourning which ends only with
the mortuary feast.</p>

<h5>DEATH AND BURIAL OF ONE KILLED BY AN ENEMY, OF A WARRIOR CHIEF, AND
OF A PRIEST</h5>
</center>

<p>As one killed by an enemy is thought to have suffered no ill through
the machinations of the evil ones, his death is considered a glorious
one, and he is buried fearlessly. It sometimes happens that, due to the
distance between the place where he was killed and his home, it is found
impossible to convey his body to the settlement. He is, accordingly,
buried in some convenient spot in the forest without further ceremony.
No mortuary feast is held for him because he is supposed to enter the
abode of his chief's war deity and there to await the coming of his
chief.</p>

<p>I never witnessed the death of a warrior chief, but I made numerous
inquiries from which I gleaned the following particulars: The death and
burial of a warrior chief seems not to differ from that of an ordinary
person except in the greater pomp displayed and in the absence of fear.
The tutelary war deities, either one or several, of the warrior chief
are present and the evil spirits are said to maintain a respectful
distance. The war chief's spirit companions or souls, which it is
maintained are susceptible to injury at the hands of demons, are present
and accompany him to the home of his tutelar deities, as do also
Mandaláñgan or Mandayáñgan, the great ancestral hero of Manóboland.</p>

<p>The war chief has no special burial ground, nor any special mode of
sepulture, though I heard on the upper part of the Tágo River, in the
eastern part on Mindanáo, that a certain Ónkui, an acquaintance of mine,
had been buried in a dugout placed on the summit of a mountain. This
report appears from further investigation to be true. I have heard of a
similar practice at the headwaters of the Ihawán River.</p>

<p>There is no material difference between the mortuary customs at the
death of a priest and those practiced at that of a warrior chief. The
tutelar deities of the priest are all present, together with all their
relatives and friends of the unseen world. His seven spirit companions
or souls are also present, so that little or no fear of the uncanny
demons is exhibited by the mourners.</p>

<center>
<a name="3F28"></a>
<h5>THE AFTER WORLD</h5>
</center>

<p>The land of Ibú is described as being somewhere down below the
pillars of the earth. It is said to resemble, in all particulars, this
world of ours. Lofty mountains, lakes, rivers, and plains, such as are
seen in the Agúsan Valley, exist there. About halfway between this world
and the big country of Ibú, mistress of the lower world, is a large
river described to me as being as big as the Agúsan, but with red water.
Here lives Manduyápit, the ferryman. From Manduyápit's to Ibú's is said
to be a journey of seven days along a good broad trail. Americans,
Spaniards, and peoples of other nations do not pass on the Manóbo's
trail because each is said to have its own, and the country of Ibú is
said to be divided into districts, one for each nation.</p>

<p>Hence, when the soul or spirit companion of the deceased finds that
it is all alone, its fellow spirit having been ruthlessly seized and
devoured, it begins its long journey to Ibú's. One week's travel brings
it to the great red river. Here it is ferried across gratuitously by
Manduyápit, and begins the second half of its journey. On arriving at
Ibú's it naturally seeks the spirits of its relatives, preferably its
nearest relative, and takes up its abode with them. If Manduyápit, for
one reason or another, should refuse to ferry it across, it returns to
its starting place and plagues its former friends for aid. The priest is
made aware of this and interprets to the relatives of the returning one
the reason for its failure to pass the great red river.</p>

<p>If the souls of the deceased should desire to pay a visit to their
living relatives, they invoke the family deities and are borne back to
the world on the wings of the wind, without having to undergo the
fatigues of the 14 days' journey.</p>

<p>Ibú's great settlement is no gloomy Hades, nor, on the other hand, is
it a paradise of celestial joy. It is simply a continuation of the
present life, except that all care and worry and trouble are ended. The
spirits of deceased earthly relatives take up their abode in one house
and pass a quiet existence under the mild sway of Ibú. There they eat,
work, and even marry. Occasionally, with the aid of the family deities
with whom they can commune, they pay a brief visit to the home of their
living relatives and then return to the tranquil realms of Ibú as
fleetly as they came.</p>

<h5>THE DEATH FEAST<sup>41</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>41</sup><i>Ka-ta-pú-san</i>, meaning end, termination.</p>

<p>The death feast is the most important of all Manóbo feasts, for it
marks the ending of all relations between the living and their departed
relatives. Until its celebration the immediate relatives of the deceased
are said to fare poorly. In some mysterious way the departed are said to
harm them until they have received this final fete. Hence, the nearest
relative sets himself to work with all dispatch to provide the necessary
pigs, beverage, and rice for the feast. It is a common belief that
unless this celebration is as sumptuous as possible, ill luck may still
pursue them. This will explain the long delay so frequently observed
before the celebration of this festivity. I know of several such feasts
which were not held until nearly a year after the decease, the delay
being due to inability to secure sufficient edibles for the death
revels. The importance and magnitude of this feast will be readily
understood when one bears in mind the fact that, when given by a
well-to-do Manóbo, it is attended by everybody in the vicinity, and
lasts frequently for a period of seven days. It happens occasionally
that, in the interim between the death of one member of a family and the
death feast, another member of the same family goes his mortal way. In
such a case only one feast is held for the two departed ones.</p>

<p>The religious character of the feast deserves special mention. The
dinner being prepared, an ordinary winnow is set out in the middle of
the floor and on it are placed cooked rice and, when obtainable,
bananas. Around the winnowing tray are set all the requisites for a
plenteous meal. Then the relatives sit around on the floor in a circle
and each one lays on the tray his offering of betel nut to the deceased.
The family priests act as interpreters and intermediaries. The deceased
are then addressed, care being taken never to mention their names. They
are called, father, brother, etc., by relatives, and by those who are
not relatives, father of so-and-so, or sister of so-and-so, mentioning
the name of the corresponding living relative. The near relatives then
give salutary advice to the dead one as to the future dealings between
the latter and the living. They are begged to have a little patience,
are reminded that only a few years hence all will be united in the land
of Ibú, and are requested to accept this final feast as a farewell until
that time. &#34;You shall go your way and molest us not. Let this feast
be a token of good will and a final farewell till we meet you in the
realms of Ibú.&#34; Such, in brief, is the strain of discourse
consisting of exhortations, advice, supplication, and valediction[sic],
that lasts several hours.</p>

<p>Finally a handful of rice is formed by the oldest relative into an
image suggestive of a human figure and the deceased are invited to
approach and to partake of the viands. The relatives pass the rice
mannikin around, each one taking a bite or two out of it. While this is
being done, the dead are invited to eat heartily, the living relatives
exhorting the dead ones; one urging them to take more soup, another to
increase their meat, another to take more bananas, and all reminding the
deceased diners of the great expense incurred in connection with this
banquet. The priests describe the actions of the mystic diners and the
hearty appetite with which they partake of the fragrance of the viands,
after their long journey from Ibúland.</p>

<p>During the mystic meal no one dares to approach the rice winnow, but
when the meal is finished, those who carried the deceased to his last
resting place approach the winnow and, raising it up in their hands,
with an upward movement conjointly toss the victuals into the air,
retreating instantly to avoid the food in its fall, for should a
particle of it touch their persons it is considered a prognostication of
speedy death. The origin and significance of this peculiar custom, which
I witnessed on many occasions, have never been explained to me. Inquiry
elicited no further information than that it was the custom.</p>

<p>Such is the repast of the dead and the ending of all relations
between them and the living. Henceforth they are not feasted, as they
have no more claim on the hospitality of the living. In all the greater
religious celebrations, however, they are present and receive an
offering of betel nut, which is placed at the doorway for them but they
are not invited to the feast.</p>

<p>The secular and social part of the feast in no wise differ from any
other celebration, except that those who buried the deceased have marked
attention paid them. There are the same motley group of primitive men
and women, the same impartial distribution of the food, the same wild
shouts of merriment, the same rivalry to finish each one his allotted
portion, the same generous reciprocation of food and drink, and,
finally, the same condition of inebriation that on many such occasions
has abruptly terminated the feast by a fatal quarrel.<sup>42</sup></p>

<p><sup>42</sup>An instance of a killing had taken place a short time
before my visit in 1909 to the Manóbos of the Binuñgñgaan River, upper
Agúsan.</p>

<p>The rest of the day, and probably a goodly portion of the night, are
spent in dancing to the tattooing of the drum and the clanging of the
gong, interrupted at times by long tribal chants of the priests and
others versed in chronicles of Manóboland.</p>

<p>If the death revels continue more than one day, the second day is a
repetition of the first with the exception that only the betel-nut
offering is made to the dead. As the celebration of this mortuary feast
is the termination of the anxious period of mourning, and the release
from the subtle secret importunateness of the dead, everybody with his
wife and children flocks to the scene. No relative of the departed one
may be absent for that would leave him still exposed to the strange
waywardness of the envious dead.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>
<h3>SOCIAL ENJOYMENTS</h3>

<a name="3G1"></a>
<h4>INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC</h4>

<a name="3G11"></a>
<h5>THE DRUM</h5>
</center>

<p>The drum is the instrument of universal use in Manóboland. Wherever
one travels, by day or by night, its measured booming may be heard. It
is made out of a piece of a palm tree, by removing the core and bark. It
is ordinarily about 25 centimeters high by 20 centimeters in diameter.
The top and bottom consist, in nearly every case, of a piece of
deerskin,<sup>1</sup> from which the fur has been scraped, a little
fringe of it, however, being left around the edges to prevent the hide
from slipping when stretched. The stretching is effected by means of
rattan rings or girdles, very often covered with cloth, and just large
enough to fit the cylindrical body of the drum. A few blows with a piece
of wood forces these girdles down the sides of the drum, thereby
stretching the heads perfectly tight so as to give the drum the proper
tone. After a certain amount of heating over the fire the drum is ready
for use. No attempts at ornamentation are made, the heavy ends of the
hide being left protruding in an ungainly way.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Monkey and lizard skins are made use of in rare
instances, and I have heard it said that the skin of a dog makes a very
fine drumhead.</p>

<p>The drum is played at either end, and in certain tunes at both ends.
The left hand serves to bring out the notes corresponding to our bass.
The drum is tapped, with more or less force and rapidity, on an upturned
head with the left hand, while the right hand with a piece of wood,
preferably a little slat of bamboo, raps out the after beat. Manóbo men,
women, and children can play the drum and mention the names of from 20
to 50 rhythms, each one of which is to their trained ears so different
that it can be recognized at once. The rhythms are varied by the number
of beats of the right hand to one of the left, and by the different
degrees of speed with which the tune is played. The general beat may be
compared to the dactyl of ancient Greek and Roman versification. The
left hand plays the long syllable, if we may so speak, while the right
plays the two short ones. The combinations, however, are as intricate as
the versification just referred to.</p>

<p>As the nomenclature<sup>2</sup> used in speaking of the tunes
indicates, the various forms of drum music are based on imitations of
animals and birds, or are adapted to certain occasions, such as the war
roll signaling for help.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>The following are some of the names of drum-tunes:
<i>Sin-ak-aí-sá-kai</i> (significant of the movement of a raft or
canoe); <i>kum-bá-kum-bá to u-sá</i> (imitative of the sporting of a
deer); <i>kin-am-pi-lán</i> (indicative of the flourishing of the Moro
weapon called <i>kampilan)</i>; <i>Min-an-dá-ya</i>, an adaptation from
the Mandáyas; <i>bo-túñg-bó-tuñg</i>, <i>ka-ta-hud-án</i>,
<i>ya-mút-yá-mut</i>, <i>pa-di-dít</i>, <i>pin-án-dan</i>,
<i>pa-tug-da-dúk tí-bañg</i>, <i>min-añg-gu-áñg-an</i>,
<i>tin-úm-pi</i>, <i>ma-sañg-aú-it</i>, <i>to-mán-do</i>,
<i>in-ág-kui</i>, <i>pa-dú-au</i>, <i>bin-ág-bad</i>, <i>pai-úm-bug</i>,
<i>pa-dúg-kug</i>, <i>tum-bá-lig</i>, <i>mañg-úd</i>.</p>

<p>To one who hears Manóbo drum music for the first time, it sounds dull
and monotonous, but as the ear grows accustomed to the roll the compass
can be detected and the skill of the drummer becomes apparent. Now loud
and then soft, now fast and then slow, the tune is rattled off in
perfect measure and with inspiring verve. As one travels through the
crocodile-infested lake region in the middle Agúsan on a calm night, the
Manóbo drums may be heard tattooing from distant settlements. They
produce a solemn but weird impression on the listener.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G12"></a>
<h5>THE GONG</h5>
</center>

<p>The gong<sup>3</sup> is of the small imported type and is purchased
from Bisáya traders. As these gongs, when new, have several ornamental
triangular figures on the front, the Manóbo is taught to value them at
as many pesos minus one as the gong has figures. This gives a gong that
cost originally about 2 pesos a value of 4 or 5 pesos.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>A-guñg</i>.</p>

<p>As a musical instrument it is played in combination with the drum.
Suspended from something or held up in the hand, it is beaten on the
knob with a piece of wood. The general time kept is the same as that
kept by the left hand of the drummer. Its constant clanging serves to
heighten the animation of the dance.</p>

<p>Both the drum and gong have a certain religious character. They are
used in all greater religious celebrations and seem to be a part of the
paraphernalia of the priest, for they are nearly always kept in his
house.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G13"></a>
<h5>FLUTES</h5>
</center>

<p>The flute, unlike the drum and gong, has no religious idea whatsoever
associated with it. It is played at the caprice of the tribesman, to
while away a weary hour, to amuse the baby, or to entertain a
visitor.</p>

<p>The melody produced by it is soft and low, plaintive and melancholy,
resembling in general features Chinese music, with its ever recurring
and prolonged trill, its sudden rises and falls, and its abrupt
endings.</p>

<p>Flutes are not used by women, and not all men have attained a
knowledge of them. Here and there one meets a man who is an expert and
who is glad to display his skill.</p>

<p>The tunes are said to be suggestive of birds' and animals'
cries<sup>4</sup> and seem to be the product of each.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>The more common pieces are: <i>Sin-a-gáu to bu-á-da</i>
(the roaring of the crocodile), <i>bu-a-bú-a to á-mo</i> (the monkey
scare), and the <i>din-a-go-yu-án</i>.</p>

<p>Flutes are made from the internodes of a variety of bamboo and are of
four kinds, depending on the number and position of the fingerholes.</p>

<a name="3G131"></a>
<p><i>The paúndag flute</i>.<sup>5</sup>--The <i>paúndag</i> is the
commonest form. The joints of the bamboo are cut off and the
circumference of the resulting internode is measured accurately with a
piece of <i>abaká</i> or other fiber. With this for a measure, 16 marks
or rings are cut on the segment and at each end beyond the first and
last mark, a distance equal to one-half the circumference is marked off,
the remainder of the segment being then cut off square at each end. At
the eighth mark a hole about 8 millimeters in diameter is cut or burned
in the bamboo. The same is done, but on the opposite side, at the ninth,
eleventh, twelfth, and fourteenth marks, respectively. The ends are then
cut in much the same shape as an ordinary whistle, and the flute, a
segment of bamboo about 1 meter long, is ready for use.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>Called also <i>pan-dag</i>.</p>

<p>While being played, it is held in a vertical position, the side with
the one fingerhole being toward the body of the player. The end with the
first mark, that which is farther away from the fingerholes, is placed
just under the upper lip. The thumb and middle finger of the right hand
control the openings at the eighth and ninth marks, while those at the
eleventh and twelfth are covered by the first and middle fingers of the
left hand, respectively, the hole at the fourteenth mark being
uncovered.</p>

<p>The blowing is performed without effort in the gentlest way possible,
as a very slight increase in the force of the breath raises the tone
about two octaves.</p>

<a name="3G132"></a>
<p><i>The to-áli flute</i>.--The <i>to-áli</i> is an abbreviated form of
the flute just described and is made in a similar way, except that only
10 divisions are made, and that on one side two holes are made at the
fifth and seventh marks, and on the other at the fourth and sixth
openings, respectively. There is no fifth fingerhole. This form of flute
is played like the <i>paúndag</i> flute, except that the thumb and
middle fingers of the right hand cover the fifth and sixth openings,
respectively, while the thumb and fourth finger of the left hand control
the seventh and eighth openings.</p>

<p>In pitch this form of flute is considerably higher than the previous
one but in other respects the music is similar.</p>

<a name="3G133"></a>
<p><i>The lántui flute</i>,<sup>6</sup>--A flute known as <i>lántui</i>
is in existence, but I am not acquainted with the details of it.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>Called also <i>yántui</i>.</p>

<a name="3G134"></a>
<p><i>The sá-bai flute</i>.--The <i>sá-bai</i> flute differs from the
three already mentioned in being a direct flute. The joint at one end of
the bamboo is cut off. Seven circumference lengths are then marked off,
beginning at the remaining joint, and holes are made at the first (that
is, the point), fifth, sixth, and seventh divisions, one or more holes
being added in the center between the sixth and seventh divisions. For a
mouthpiece, a segment of bamboo about 2 centimeters long is placed over
the jointed end of the flute at the first division but in such a way as
not to cover completely the opening at that point.</p>

<p>The sound is produced by the breath passing through the opening last
mentioned and <i>striking the edge of the aperture</i> that it partially
covers.</p>

<p>When played, this form of flute is held in a horizontal position. The
point is inserted into the mouth and the three consecutive holes at
divisions Nos. 5, 5.5, and 6 are covered by the first, second, and third
fingers, respectively, of the right hand.</p>

<p>In pitch this instrument is lower than the other three but in the
quality of the music it in no wise differs from them.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G14"></a>
<h5>GUITARS</h5>
</center>

<a name="3G141"></a>
<p><i>The vine-string guitar</i>.--There are two kinds of vine-string
guitars, differing only in size and name, as far as I know, so that a
description of the smaller one<sup>7</sup> will answer for the
larger.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>Kúd-luñg</i>.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Bin-i-já-an</i>.</p>

<p>It varies in length from 1.5 meters to 2 meters.<sup>9</sup> The
combined neck and finger board and the hollow boat-shaped sounding box
are of one piece. The other part of the guitar is a thin strip of wood
with a lozenge-shaped hole in the center, that fits with great accuracy
on the bottom of the sounding box. The head is always a scroll, rudely
carved into a remote suggestion of a rooster's head, as the name
indicates,<sup>10</sup> and two holes are pierced in it for the
insertion of the tuning pegs. Along the neck are from 9 to 12 little
wooden frets, fastened to the finger board with beeswax. I can give no
information as to the rule by which the interfret distances are
determined.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>Ordinarily the <i>bán-ti</i> or the <i>sa-gu-bád-bad</i>
wood is used.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup><i>Min-an-úk</i>, from <i>manuk</i>, a fowl.</p>

<p>The strings are two in number and extend from the tuning pegs through
two holes in the neck and over the finger board and the sounding box to
an elevated piece left on the sounding piece. An interesting feature of
these strings is that they are the central part or core of a small
vine<sup>11</sup> and give out rather sweet tones, though not so loud as
catgut.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup><i>Bís-lig</i>.</p>

<p>Projecting from the end of the sounding box, and forming one
continuous piece with it, is an ornamental piece carved into a semblance
of the favorite fowl head.</p>

<p>The guitar is held like guitars the world over, and the playing is
performed by twanging the strings with a little plectrum of bamboo or
wood.<sup>12</sup></p>

<p><sup>12</sup>As to the tuning and modulating of the instrument I can
give no information. The matter requires further study.</p>

<p>The quality of the music is soft and melancholy, wholly in minor keys
and of no great range, probably not exceeding one octave. As far as I
can judge it bears a resemblance to Chinese music. Various tunes are
played on both forms of guitar according to the caprice and skill of the
performer.<sup>13</sup></p>

<p><sup>13</sup>The following are the names of some of the melodies:
<i>Di-u-wá-ta ko</i> (Oh, my familiar spirit), <i>a-yáu-u-yáu-á</i>
(don't, oh, don't), <i>to-láñg-it</i> (the sky), <i>i-ka-nuñg-úd</i>,
<i>ta-ta-lí-buñg</i>, <i>pan-in-ó-ug</i>, <i>mi-a-pí tin-ig-bás-ai</i>,
<i>du-yúg-dú-yug</i>, <i>ta-ga-lín-dug</i>, <i>tiñg-ga-sau</i>,
<i>ma-sú-gud</i>, <i>pa-má-bá to ba-ku-ta</i>, <i>da-gí-tan</i>.</p>

<p>There are no special occasions for playing this guitar. It is not
played by women nor is it used as an accompaniment for singing. The
performer takes up the instrument as the whim prompts him and in the
semidarkness plays his rude, melancholy tune.</p>

<a name="3G142"></a>
<p><i>The bamboo string guitar</i>.<sup>14</sup>--The bamboo guitar is
made of an internode of one of the larger varieties of
bamboo.<sup>15</sup> Five small cylindrical strips are cut along the
surface and small wedges of wood are inserted under them at the ends to
stretch them and retain them in an elevated position. These strips
extend from joint to joint. There are usually two bass strings on one
side and three treble strings on the other. Between these treble bass
strings is a longitudinal slit in the bamboo joint intended to increase
the resonance of the instrument. The strings are at intervals of about 3
centimeters. Two holes are made in the joint walls, the purpose of which
is to increase the volume of sound.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup><i>Tan-kó</i>.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup><i>Pa-túñg</i>, <i>da-nu-án</i>, <i>kai-yaú-an</i>.</p>

<p>The tuning is regulated by the size of the little wedges which impart
greater or lesser tension as desired. I understand neither the theory
nor the practice of tuning this guitar.</p>

<p>While being played the guitar is held in both hands. The first finger
and thumb of the right hand manipulate the bass strings, while the three
treble strings are controlled by the other hand.</p>

<p>The weird staccato music produced by this instrument is
indescribable. One must hear it and hear it repeatedly in order to
appreciate its fantastic melodies.</p>

<p>Both men and women make use of it for secular and, I am inclined to
think, for religious motives. During the famous
<i>túñgud</i><sup>16</sup> movement (1908-1910) it was used universally
in the religious houses, but I was unable to obtain definite information
as to its sacred character. In the postnatal ceremony that has been
described under &#34;Birth&#34; I observed the use of the instrument on
several occasions, but could obtain no further information except that
the strains of this primitive guitar are pleasing to Mandáit, the
tutelary spirit of infants. This point merits further
investigation.<sup>17</sup></p>

<p><sup>16</sup>A religious movement that sprang up in 1908 and spread
itself all over the southeastern quarter of Mindanáo. (See Chapter
XXIX.)</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>The following are the names of some of the tunes played
on the above guitar: <i>ma-sú-gud</i>, <i>tám-bid</i>,
<i>gam-aú-gá-mau</i>, <i>pa-ma-yá-bui</i>, <i>tig-ba-bau</i>.</p>

<a name="3G143"></a>
<p><i>The takúmbo</i>.--Though classed here as guitar, the
<i>takúmbo</i> hardly deserves the name. It is a bamboo joint which has
one joint wall opened. At the other end beyond the second joint it is so
cut as to resemble a miter. Two strings, uplifted from the surface about
4 centimeters apart, and held in an elevated position and at their
requisite tension by little wooden wedges placed underneath, form the
strings. A lozenge-shaped hole in the center between the strings
increases the resonance. The instrument is played by beating the strings
with little sticks preferably of bamboo. Two persons may play at one
time.</p>

<p>The time observed is the drum rhythm. The sound produced is very
faint and unimpressive, and the instrument is of very sporadic
occurrence.</p>

<p>The fact that one end is carved in the form of a miter tends to
confirm my supposition that this is a purely religious instrument. The
carving is supposed to represent the mouth of a
crocodile.<sup>18</sup></p>

<p><sup>18</sup>This figure is called <i>bin-u-á-da</i>, or
<i>bin-u-wá-ya</i> from <i>bu-á-ya</i>, crocodile.</p>

<p>I was given to understand that this instrument is used in the
immolation to the blood-deities in case of hemorrhage and such other
illnesses as are accompanied by fluxes of blood. It is said that the
instrument is set in a vertical position, the miterlike cutting being
upward, and that a part of the victim's blood is placed upon the node as
if it were a little saucer. The instrument is then played. I never
witnessed the ceremony, nor heard the instrument played, and am not
prepared to give credence to the above story till further investigation
corroborates it.</p>

<h5>THE VIOLIN<sup>19</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>19</sup><i>Kó-gut</i>.</p>

<p>I neither saw nor heard this instrument, but my inquiries
substantiate the existence of it. The body is said to be of coconut
shell with the husk removed. The bow is made of bamboo bent into the
form of a defensive bow, to the ends of which are attached several
threads of <i>abaká</i> fiber that serve as the bowstring. The strings
of the violin are two in number and are made of <i>abaká</i> fiber.</p>

<p>The violin is said to be played as our violins are by drawing the bow
across the strings. It is not played by women, according to reports, nor
are there any stated times and reasons, religious or otherwise, for its
use.<sup>20</sup></p>

<p><sup>20</sup>The names of some of the tunes played are:
<i>Pan-un-gá-kit</i>, <i>lin-íg-tui ka-bú-ka</i>, <i>ba-yú-bas</i>,
<i>pan-ig-á-bon to ka-bí</i>.</p>

<h5>THE JEW'S-HARP<sup>21</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>21</sup><i>Kubíñg</i>.</p>

<p>Another instrument which is found occasionally in Manóboland, is a
species of jew's-harp, made out of bamboo. It is a frail instrument made
more for a toy than for its musical qualities. It is ordinarily about 26
centimeters long, and consists of a slender piece of bamboo from the
central part of which a small tongue about 6 centimeters long is cut.
The tongue remains attached at one end, the tip of it being toward the
middle of the instrument. On the the reverse side there is a small
cavity in the body of the instrument intended to allow sufficient room
for the tongue of the harp to move while being played.</p>

<p>The instrument is played by putting the mouth to the above-mentioned
cavity and by blowing as we do in an ordinary jew's-harp. The tongue is
made to vibrate by tapping with the finger a needlelike spur that is
left at the end of the instrument. This vibration, in conjunction with
variations of the mouth cavity of the performer, produces tones which
are not unlike those of an ordinary jew's-harp but which are not so loud
nor so harmonious.</p>

<a name="3G17"></a>
<h5>THE STAMPER AND THE HORN<sup>22</sup> OF BAMBOO</h5>
</center>

<p><sup>22</sup><i>Tam-bú-li</i>.</p>

<p>On the upper Agúsan I witnessed the use of bamboo stampers. They
consist of large bamboo joints with one partition wall removed. They are
stamped on the floor in rhythm with the drum and gong during a dance,
the open end being held up. The use of these stampers by Manóbos is
rare, the custom being confined almost exclusively to Mañgguáñgans of
the upper Agúsan and upper Sálug Valleys.</p>

<p>Another instrument, but one which can hardly be called musical, is
the bamboo horn used for signaling and calling purposes. It consists of
an internode of bamboo with one partition wall removed. An opening large
enough for the mouth is made on the side of the bamboo near the other
node. In using it the mouth is applied to this aperture and a good pair
of lungs can produce a loud booming blast. After the occurrence of a
death, especially if the deceased has been slain, it is customary to use
this instrument as a means of announcing the death to near-by
settlements, thereby putting them on their guard against any of the
slain one's relatives who might be impelled to take immediate vengeance
on the first human being he met.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G18"></a>
<h5>SOUNDERS</h5>
</center>

<p>A method of signaling, much in use among the mixed
Manóbo-Mañgguáñgans of the upper Agúsan, consists in beating on the
butresses[sic]<sup>23</sup> of trees. It is surprising how far the
resultant sound travels in the silence and solitude of the forest.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup><i>Da-líd</i>.</p>

<p>In connection with musical instruments it may not be out of place to
mention the bamboo sounders<sup>24</sup> attached to looms. They are
internodes of bamboo with apertures in the joint wall and a longitudinal
slit extending almost from node to node. One of these always constitutes
the yarn beam of the loom.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup><i>Ka-gú</i>.</p>

<p>These internodes, besides serving to support the fabric during the
process of weaving, denote by their resonance that the weaver is busy at
work. The movement of the batten in driving home the weft produces a
sound that, owing to the resonance of the bamboo yarn beam may be heard
for several hundred meters.</p>

<p>When the Manóbo maiden is especially desirous of calling attention
'to her assiduity and perseverance, she has an extra internode placed in
an upright position against the yarn beam just described. This doubles
the volume of sound and serves to intimate to visiting young men that
she would be an industrious wife.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G2"></a>
<h4>VOCAL MUSIC</h4>
</center>

<p>Singing is as common among the Manóbos as among their countrymen of
the Christian tribes. The fond mother croons her babe to sleep with a
lullaby. In festive hours the song is the vehicle of praise, of joke, of
taunt, and of challenge, and in religious celebrations it is the medium
through which the priests address their deities.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G21"></a>
<h5>THE LANGUAGE OF SONG</h5>
</center>

<p>The language used in singing is so different from the common
vernacular that Bisáyas and Christianized Manóbos who speak and
understand perfectly the ordinary dialect of conversation find the
language of song unintelligible. I have had several songs dictated to me
and found the song words to be plainly archaic. This observation applies
also to the song-dialect of Mañgguáñgans, Debabáons and Mandáyas.</p>

<p>As interpreted to me on many occasions, songs are improvisations spun
out with endless repetitions of the same ideas in different words. To
give an instance, a mountain might be described in the song as a
&#34;beauteous hill,&#34; a &#34;fair mount,&#34; a &#34;lovely
eminence,&#34; a &#34;beautiful elevation,&#34; all depending on the
facility with which the maker<sup>25</sup> can use the language. This
feature of the song serves to explain its inordinate length, for a song
may occupy the greater part of a night, apparently without tiring the
audience by its verbose periphrases and its exuberant figures.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup><i>Pán-dui</i>, a smith or maker.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G22"></a>
<h5>THE SUBJECT MATTER OF SONGS</h5>
</center>

<p>The subjects of songs are as varied as those of other nations, but
legendary songs, in which the valiant deeds of departed warriors are
recounted, seem to be the favorite. As far as I know, the songs are
always extemporaneous and not composed of any set form of words and
verses.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G23"></a>
<h5>THE MUSIC AND THE METHOD OF SINGING</h5>
</center>

<p>One must hear the song in order to get an idea of it. In general it
is a declamatory solo. The staccatolike way in which the words are sung,
the abrupt endings, and the long slurs covering as much as an octave
remind one somewhat of Chinese singing. The singer's voice frequently
ascends to its highest natural tone and, after dwelling there for from
three to six seconds, suddenly slurs down an octave, where it remains
playing around three or four consecutive semitones.</p>

<p>There is no choral singing and no accompaniment. No time is observed,
the song having wholly the character of a recitation. Neither are there
any attempts at rhyming nor at versification. Recurring intervals are
the rule.</p>

<p>The music is, in general, of minor tonality and, unless the subject
of the song is fighting or doing some other thing that demands loudness,
rapidity, and animation, it is of a weird, melancholy character. When,
however, the subject of the song requires anything of the
<i>spiritoso</i> or <i>veloce</i>, the strain is sung with verve and
even furore. It seems to be good etiquette to cover the mouth with the
hand when the singer, desiring to add special vigor to the strain, rises
to his highest natural pitch and dwells there with an almost deafening
prolonged yell.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G24"></a>
<h5>CEREMONIAL SONGS<sup>26</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>26</sup><i>Túd-um</i>.</p>

<p>Sacred songs, as distinguished from secular songs for festive and
other occasions, are sung only by the priests and by warrior chiefs.
They are supposed to be taught by a special divinity.<sup>27</sup> The
remarks that apply to music and singing in general apply to these
religious songs. The only difference is that sacred singing is the
medium by which the spirits are invoked, supplicated, and propitiated,
and by which the doings of the supernatural world are communicated to
Manóbodom. These ceremonial chants are performed not only during
religious celebrations but more commonly at night. The greater part of
the night is often worn away with a protracted diffuse narration in
which is described, with grandiloquent circumlocution and copious
imagery, the doings of the unseen world.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup><i>Tu-tu-dú-mon no diu-wá-ta</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G3"></a>
<h4>DANCING</h4>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo dance is somewhat on the style of an Irish jig or a Scotch
hornpipe. It is indulged in on nearly all occasions of social and
ceremonial celebrations. Though it may be performed at any time of the
day if there is a call for it, yet it usually takes place in the evening
or at night, and especially after a drinking bout, when the feasters are
feeling extra cheerful in their cups. There are no special dance houses
in Manóboland, the ordinary dwelling place of the host serving the
purpose. Whenever the floor is in poor condition (and that is often the
case) a mat or two may be spread upon it for the safety of the dancer.
This may be done out of respect also.</p>

<p>Though dances are held the year round during all great rejoicings and
during the greater sacrificial celebrations, it is during the harvesting
season that they are given with greatest frequency.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G31"></a>
<h5>THE ORDINARY SOCIAL DANCE</h5>
</center>

<p>By the social dance is meant the dance which takes place on an
occasion of rejoicing and which is indulged in by men, women, and
children, one at a time. It is exceptional that two or more persons
dance simultaneously. A striking peculiarity in dancing is the wearing
of a woman's skirt by males during the dance. No reason is assigned for
the practice except the force of custom. It is customary, also, to array
the dancer in all the available wealth of Manóboland--waist jacket, hat,
necklaces, girdle, hawk bells, and, in case of a female, with brass
anklets. Two kerchiefs, held by the corner, one in each hand, complete
the array. No flowers nor leaves are used in the decoration of the
person during dancing.</p>

<p>The drum, and when it is available, the gong are the only musical
accompaniments to the dancing. When these are lacking an old tin can, if
such a thing by some good luck has made its way into the house, answers
the purpose of a musical instrument. Even the floor is sometimes beaten
to produce an accompaniment for the dance. On the upper Agúsan bamboo
stampers are occasionally used, in imitation of Mañgguáñgan custom, to
impart more animation to the dance.</p>

<p>The dance is never accompanied by vocal music unless the constant
scream of approbation and encouragement from the spectators be included
under that term.</p>

<p>The time to which the dancing is performed is the same as that
described under &#34;the drum&#34; at the beginning of this chapter. It
corresponds somewhat to that of our waltz when played presto, although
the movements of the feet do not correspond to those of that dance.</p>

<p>The dancer names the rhythm he desires and it is the rule, rather
than the exception, that several starts are made, and several drummers
tried before a good dancer feels satisfied with the method of playing.
This is an indication of the excellent ear which the Manóbo has
developed for this apparently rude and primitive form of music.</p>

<p>The women in dancing are more gentle in their manner than the men;
they make fewer bending motions and do not posture so much. In other
respects the dancing of the men and women is identical.</p>

<p>The step may be called dactyllic<sup>28</sup> in that a long or
accented beat is struck with one foot and, in immediate succession, two
quick short steps are taken with the other. This is varied at recurring
intervals by omitting the two short steps, especially in mimetic or
dramatic dances when the dancer desires to return to the center or to
execute some extra evolution.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup>A term borrowed from Latin and Greek versification.</p>

<p>To give a satisfactory description of the attitude and movements of
the dancer is impossible, as the skill and grace of the dance consists
essentially in postures and gestures, and each individual has his own
variations and combination. In fact no two men dance alike, though the
women are much alike in their style of dancing, due to the fact that
they bend the body and gesticulate comparatively little and that they
display less force and exertion. Suffice it to say that the dancer moves
his feet in perfect time to the rhythm of the drum and gong, at the same
time keeping the arms, hands, fingers, head, and shoulders in constant
movement. Now one hand is laid upon the hip while the other is extended
upward and at an oblique angle from the shoulder. Again both hands are
placed upon the hips and the dancer trips around a few times when
suddenly turning, he retires hastily, but in perfect time, with both
arms extended upwards and at an angle from the shoulders, the two
kerchiefs waving all the time to the movements of the body. During all
his movements the arms, hands, and fingers are twisted and turned with
graceful and varied, but measured, modulation. Now he raises one
shoulder and then another. Now he gazes up with a look of defiance upon
his countenance, as if at some imaginary foe, and then down, as if in
quest of something. At one time he stops and gently moves his feet to
the rhythm of the music for several seconds, at another he circles
around with uplifted arms and flying kerchiefs, and scurries to the
other end of the dancing space, as if pursued by some foeman. At this
point he may circle around again and, the music of the drum and gong
surging loud, stamp defiance as if at an imaginary enemy, in measured
beat and with quick, wild movements of the legs and the whole body.</p>

<p>And thus the dance goes on, now slow, now fast, now stately, now
grotesque, the feet pounding the floor in regular and exact time to the
music, and every part of the body moving, according to the whim of the
dancer, with graceful and expressive modulation.</p>

<p>The whole dance requires great exertion, as is evidenced by the
perspiration that appears upon the dancer's body after a few minutes.
For this reason, a dancer rarely continues for more than ten minutes. He
names his successor by dancing up to him, and putting the kerchiefs on
his shoulders. The appointee nearly always excuses himself on the plea
that he does not know how to dance, that his foot is sore, or with some
other excuse, but finally yields to the screams of request and
exhortation from the encircling spectators.</p>

<p>One who has witnessed a Manóbo dance at night by the flare of fire
and torch will not forget the scene. Squatted around in the semidarkness
are the russet figures of the merry, primitive spectators, lit up by the
flickering glare of the unsteady light, the children usually naked, and
the men having frequently bared the upper parts of their bodies. In the
center circles the dancer with his wealth of ornaments, advancing,
retreating, and posturing. The drum booms, the gong clangs, and the
dancer pounds the floor in rhythm. The jingle bells and the wire anklets
of the dancer tinkle. The spectators scream in exultation,
encouragement, and approval. The dogs add to the pandemonium by an
occasional canine chorus of their own, which coupled with the crying of
the babies and several other incidental sounds, serves to enhance the
rejoicing and to add eclat to the celebration.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G32"></a>
<h5>THE RELIGIOUS DANCE</h5>
</center>

<p>Unlike the secular dance just described, the sacred dance is
performed exclusively by the male and female priests and by the warrior
chiefs of the tribes. It may be performed either in the house or out on
the ground, according to the place selected for the sacrifice. In the
case of the sacrifice of a pig, the dance and its accompanying rites are
always performed out of doors near the house of one of the priests.</p>

<p>The dress of the priests is always as elaborate as possible, as in
ordinary festive dancing. Their various portable charms and talismans
are always worn around the neck and, instead of kerchiefs being held in
the hands, palm fronds<sup>29</sup> are used, one in each hand.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup><i>Ma-yún-hau</i>.</p>

<p>The music is similar to that described for the ordinary dance, and
the step and movements are identical except that the dance is more
moderate, there being no attempt at grotesque or fantastic movements. As
it is usually performed before an altar, a mat is spread upon the floor,
so that the dancing range is limited. In general, the sacred dance
presents, in its simplicity and its lack of violent contortions, rapid
motions, and gestures, an element of respect and religious quietude that
is not observed in secular dancing. The encircling spectators do not
indulge in such unseemly acclamations, though it may be remarked that
they assume no posture indicative of religious worship, for they
continue to talk among themselves and to indulge in the ordinary
occupation of betel-nut chewing, leaving the performance of the dance
and the attendant ceremonies to the priests, whose profession it is to
attend to such matters.</p>

<p>The dance is performed either consecutively or simultaneously by the
priests but is interrupted occasionally by other rites proper to the
ceremony.<sup>30</sup></p>

<p><sup>30</sup>See Chapter XXVI.</p>

<center>
<a name="3G33"></a>
<h5>MIMETIC DANCES</h5>
</center>

<p>Mimetic dances in no wise differ from the ordinary festal dancing
except that they are a pantomimic representation, by gestures, by
postures, and by mimicry of some feature of Manóbo life. So far as I
know these dances are never performed by women.</p>

<p>Mimetic dances are very popular in Manóboland, and visitors whom it
is desired to honor, are often treated, without solicitation on their
part, to a series of these performances. They often contain an element
of what we would call lasciviousness, but to the Manóbo they merely
represent ordinary natural acts. The following are some of the mimetic
dances which I have witnessed.</p>

<a name="3G341"></a>
<p><i>The bathing dance</i>.--The dancer gyrates and pirouettes in the
ordinary style for several minutes when, by a bending movement, he
intimates the picking up of some heavy object. He simulates placing this
on his shoulder and then imitates a woman's walk, indicating thereby
that he is a woman and that he is going either to get water or take a
bath. All this, as well as subsequent representations, are performed in
perfect time to the music. By a slow movement and with many a backward
glance to see whether he is being watched, he reaches the end of the
dancing place which evidently represents the stream for he goes through
a pantomimic drinking. He then cautiously and after repeated backward
glances, divests himself of all his clothes, and begins the bathing
operations. He is frequently interrupted, and upon the supposed
appearance of a person presumably a male, he indicates that he has to
resume his skirt. The operation of washing the hair and other parts of
the body are portrayed with appropriate gestures and movements, as are
also the resuming of his dress and the return to the house with a bamboo
tubeful of water.</p>

<a name="3G342"></a>
<p><i>The dagger or sword dance</i>.--This dance is performed only by
men, two of whom may take part in it at the same time. It consists in
portraying a quarrel between them, the weapon used being either the
Mandáya dagger, as on the upper Agúsan, or the ordinary war bolo, as in
the central and lower Agúsan. Appropriate flourishes, parries, lunges,
foils, advances, and retreats, all extremely graceful and skillful, are
depicted just as if a real encounter were taking place.</p>

<a name="3G343"></a>
<p><i>The apian dance</i>.--This is a dramatic representation of the
robbing of a bee's nest. The gathering of the materials and the
formation of them into a firebrand, the lighting of it, and the ascent
of the tree, are all danced out to perfection. A striking part of the
pantomine is the apparently fierce stinging the robber undergoes,
especially on certain parts of his body.<sup>31</sup></p>

<p><sup>31</sup>The pubic region is referred to.</p>

<p>This part of the performance always draws screams of laughter from
the spectators. The whole ends with a vivid but very comic
representation of the avid consumption of the honey and beebread.</p>

<a name="3G344"></a>
<p><i>The depilation dance</i>.--This is an illustration, by dancing
movements, of the eradication of hair especially in the pubic region.
The dancer, indicating by continual glances that he is afraid of being
seen, simulates the depilation of the pubic hair. The pain thereby
inflicted he manifests by the most comic contortions of his
face.<sup>32</sup></p>

<p><sup>32</sup>Though depilation of the pubic region is represented in
dancing, I do not know positively that it takes place in reality.</p>

<a name="3G345"></a>
<p><i>The sexual dance</i>.--This is a dramatic representation of sexual
intercourse on the part of one who apparently has made no overtures or
any previous arrangements with the object of his desire. He is supposed
to enter the house and approach the recumbent object of his love (in
this case represented by a piece of wood or of bamboo) in a timorous,
stealthy way. A hand to the ear intimates that he thinks he hears some
one approaching. He therefore retires a little distance, and after
reassuring himself that all is well, proceeds to attain his object. It
is only after protracted circling, approaching, and retiring, that he
simulates the attainment of his desire. No indications of bashfulness
nor delicacy are exhibited, by the female spectators.<sup>33</sup></p>

<p><sup>33</sup>I have been informed that sexual relations between a hen
and a rooster form the main feature of another mimetic dance.</p>

<a name="3G346"></a>
<p><i>The war dance</i>.--The war dance is performed outside of the
house on the ground by one man alone or by two men simultaneously. The
dancer is attired in full festive array with hat and red turban, and is
armed with lance, war bolo, and shield.</p>

<p>The accompaniment to the dance is the drum, but both the rhythm
executed on it and the step performed by the dancer baffled description.
Suffice it to say that the music is a continuous roll tattooed by two
expert players, one at each end of the drum. The dancer keeps his feet
moving with the greatest conceivable velocity in perfect unison to the
rhythm which gives one the general impression of a rapid two-step. The
movement of the feet reminds one of the movements made by a rooster or a
turkey cock at times. The nodding of the head of the dancer is also
similar to that of a game-cock before a fight.</p>

<p>As the dance is supposed to represent an encounter and harid-to-hand
fight, all the movements of advancing and retreating, thrusting and
parrying are displayed. The combatants move around in circles, now
approaching, now receding, always under the protection of the shield.
They gaze savagely at each other, now over the shield, now at the side,
constantly sticking out their tongues at each other much as a snake
does. At times they place a heel in the ground with upraised foot, and
with the knee placed against the shield, and lance poised horizontally
above the shoulder, make rapid darts at each other. Every once in a
while they kneel down on one leg behind their shields and with rapid
movements of the head and spear look defiance at each other. During all
the movements of the dance the spear is held horizontally and is thrust
forward rapidly. The shoulders are constantly moved up and down, and the
shield follows this movement, all being in perfect time to the rapid
roll of the drum.</p>

<p>The dance ordinarily does not last more than five minutes as the
extreme exertion and rapidity of movement soon tire the dancer. It is a
magnificent display of warlike skill and of physical agility and
endurance.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>
<h3>POLITICAL ORGANIZATION: SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL CONTROL</h3>

<a name="3H1"></a>
<h4>CLANS</h4>

<a name="3H11"></a>
<h5>TERRITORIES OF THE CLANS AND NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMPOSING THEM</h5>
</center>

<p>Manóboland, with the exception of such settlements as have been
formed by non-Christian Manóbos in the vicinity of Christian
<i>settlements</i> and usually situated at the head of navigation on the
tributaries of the Agúsan, is divided into districts, well defined, and,
in case of hostility, jealously and vigilantly guarded. These
territorial divisions vary in extent from a few square miles to immense
tracts of forest and are usually bounded by rivers and streams or by
mountains and other natural landmarks. Each of these districts is
occupied by a clan that consists of a nominal superior with his family,
sons-in-law, and such other of his relatives as may have decided to live
within the district. They may number only 20 souls and again they may
reach a few hundred.</p>

<center>
<a name="3H12"></a>
<h5>INTERCLAN RELATIONS</h5>
</center>

<p>In the main it may be said that in time of peace the members of the
various clans live on good terms, visiting one another and claiming
relationship with one another, but peace in Manóboland was formerly very
transitory. A drunken brawl might stir up bad blood and every clan and
every individual would make ready for a fight.</p>

<p>The Agúsan Valley was styled by Montano, the French traveler, &#34;Le
pais de terreur,&#34; and from the accounts given to me it must have
deserved the name. A perusal of the &#34;Cartas de los PP. de la
Compañia de Jesus,&#34; which set forth the religious conquest of the
Agúsan Valley, begun about 1875, will give an idea of the continuous
raids and ambuscades that interfered to no inconsiderable extent with
the work of Christian conquest undertaken by the missionaries. Upon my
arrival in the Agúsan in 1905 such rivers as the Ihawán, the Baóbo, the
upper Umaíam, the upper Argáwan, and all tributaries of the upper
Agúsan, were seldom visited by any but members of the clan to whose
territorial jurisdiction these rivers and the adjoining districts
belonged. The establishment of a special form of government on the lower
and middle Agúsan, now known as the subprovince of Butuán, did wonders
toward repressing the interclan raids, but on the upper Agúsan they
continued at least until my departure in 1910, though not to such an
extent as in previous years.</p>

<p>For example, in February, 1910, the settlements of Dugmánon and
Moncáyo were in open hostility. I traveled both by land and water with
members of the two unfriendly clans. In traveling by water it was
necessary to proceed in midstream with shields protecting the occupants
of the canoe against the arrows of their enemies. On the trail it was
imperative to travel in bodies with a warrior on each side of the trail
to guard against ambush.</p>

<p>This feud arose out of a mere bagatelle, followed by the seizure of a
pig, and up to the time I left the region had given rise to four deaths.
I made every effort to adjudicate the case, but as each clan seemed
unwilling to yield, failed to bring the parties together.</p>

<h4>THE CHIEF AND HIS POWER</h4>

<a name="3H21"></a>
<h5>THE SOURCE OF THE CHIEF'S AUTHORITY</h5>
</center>

<p>It may be said in general that the chief is a man who, by his fluency
of speech and by his penetration and sagacity in unraveling the
intricate points of a dispute, by his personal prowess, combined with
sagacity and fair dealing, has won influence. Personal prowess appeals
to the Manóbo, so that in time of hostility the warrior chief is looked
up to more than any man who in time of peace might have enjoyed more
influence and prestige.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the whole political organization of
Manóboland, including the system of government, social control, and
administration of justice, is essentially patriarchal, so that the
chieftainship is really only a nominal one. The very entity of a clan
springs from the kinship of its individual members, and, as in a family,
the stronger or abler brother might be selected on a given occasion to
represent, defend, or otherwise uphold the family, so in a Manóbo clan
or sect the stronger or the wiser member is recognized as chief.
However, he can not lay claim to any legal authority nor use any
coercion unless it is sanctioned by the more influential members of the
clan, is approved by public opinion, and is in conformity with customary
law and tribal practices, for there is no people that I know of that is
so tenacious and so jealous of ancient usages as the Manóbos of eastern
Mindanáo.</p>

<center>
<a name="3H22"></a>
<h5>EQUALITY AMONG THE PEOPLE</h5>
</center>

<p>Besides the titles applied to warrior chiefs and to priests, there is
no title that is in common use to express the influence and authority
wielded by any individual. It is not infrequent to hear of so-and-so
being spoken of as a <i>datu</i> by the Bisáyas of the Agúsan Valley,
but the title is not used by Manóbos, but only by the Banuáon group
inhabiting the northwestern part of the valley or by Bisáyas when they
desire to cajole their Manóbo friends. The term <i>kuláno</i> is
sometimes used by the Bisáyas, but as far as my knowledge goes is not
used by Manóbos. It is in all probability a form of the word
<i>kuláno</i> that is applied, I think, to Bukídnon chiefs in the
subprovince of Bukídnon. The fact that no titles appear to exist for
influential men except that of warrior chief and of priest is an
indication of the inferiority of the Manóbo to the Mandáya in tribal
organization.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p><sup>1</sup>In Mandáya a very influential chief is styled
<i>á-ri-á-ri</i>, a kind of petty king, and the elder of a settlement or
even of an individual house has a special name, significative of
influence and of respect, to wit, <i>ma-tá-duñg</i>.</p>

<p>There is no hereditary chieftainship, though a warrior chief makes
earnest endeavors to instill the spirit of valor into his first born
male child from the time he attains the use of reason. No insignia are
worn except by the warrior chief and the recognized warrior<sup>2</sup>
to denote the influence that they exert in the tribe or in the clan.
Perfect equality is conspicuous in nearly all things. The chief or the
warrior chief sallies forth, often in company with his slaves, and takes
part in fishing and in hunting expeditions. On the trail he may carry
his own share of the burden if he has been unable to induce others to
take it. I have had warrior chiefs, priests, and other influential
people many a time act as my carriers, but, of course, out of courtesy
and respect, had to allow them more in the way of recompense than was
given to those of lesser importance. The chief has no subordinate
officers, no heralds, and no assembly house. He lives in his own house
and when any trouble arises he settles it, in company with other
influential men, either at his own house or at any other house to which
it may have been deemed expedient to repair. Hence we may say that
little or no formal demonstration of respect is shown a chief. He is a
Manóbo of more than usual ability, of strong character, quick to
discover the intricacies of an involved question, facile of tongue,
loved for his hospitality and generous nature, more frequently better
provided with worldly goods than his fellow clansmen, and as a rule with
a reputation for fair dealing. Such are, in general, the sources of the
respect that gives him a moral weight in the arbitration of clan
troubles or even of tribal concerns when no hostility reigns.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>Ma-ni-ki-ád</i>.</p>

<p>I have never heard among the Manóbos of any special celebration in
which a chief, other than a warrior chief, is formally recognized. He
seems to grow gradually into recognition, just as one brother of a
family may, after years of demonstrated ability, be looked up to by the
rest of the family.</p>

<center>
<a name="3H23"></a>
<h5>RESPECT FOR ABILITY AND OLD AGE</h5>
</center>

<p>Although the chiefs almost invariably look upon other men of the
tribe as their equals and show no affectation because of their position,
yet by those who come in contact with them a certain amount of respect
is shown. This is especially true in the great social and religious
gatherings and on the visit of a chief to another house. Here he gets an
extra supply of pork and of brew and of everything that is being
distributed.</p>

<p>From what has been said in a previous part of this monograph it is
obvious that women play no part in the control of public affairs. There
are no female chiefs. Women are domestic chattels relegated to the house
and to the farm. There is a common saying that women have no
tribunal--that is, are not fitted to take part in public
discussions--the reference being to the town hall of the Spanish regime.
Yet I know of one woman, Sinápi by name, who travels around like a chief
and through her influence arbitrates questions that the more influential
men of the region are unable to settle. She lives on the Simúlao River,
just above the settlement of San Isidro, and is without doubt the
individual of most influence on the upper Simúlao and Bahaían. In the
Jesuit letters mention is made of one Pínkai who had great weight among
her fellow tribesmen of the Argáwan River.</p>

<p><i>Ceteris peribus</i>, the word and authority of the old are
respected more than those of others, probably because the former have
more numerous relatives, including often their great-grandsons and
great-granddaughters, as well as the indefinite number of relatives by
marriage that have joined the family since their first sons or their
first daughters married. When, however, they reach the age at which they
can no longer travel around and take part in the numerous imbroglios and
disputes that arise their influence is much less. This, it seems, is one
of the great differences between the social system of the Mandáyas and
that of the Manóbos and will explain the greater constancy and stability
of the Mandáya character as compared with that of the Manóbo.</p>

<center>
<a name="3H3"></a>
<h4>THE WARRIOR CHIEF<sup>3</sup></h4>
</center>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Ba-gá-ni</i> from <i>ba-rá-ni</i> (Malay), valiant.</p>

<p>The sword in Manóboland, as in all other parts of the world, is the
final arbiter when conciliation fails. Hence the prominent part played
by the warrior chief in time of war and frequently in time of peace. For
this reason it becomes necessary to discuss at more length the powers,
prerogatives, and character of the warrior chief.</p>

<center>
<a name="3H31"></a>
<h5>GENERAL CHARACTER</h5>
</center>

<p>The general character of the warrior chief is, among all the tribes
of the Agúsan Valley, that of a warrior who has to his credit an average
of five deaths. As such deaths are attributed primarily to the special
protection of divinities, called <i>Tagbúsau</i>, who delight in the
shedding of blood, the chief is regarded in the light of a priest in all
that concerns war in somewhat the same way as the <i>bailán</i> or
ordinary priest, under the protection of his familiars of tutelary
spirits, is expected to officiate in all ordinary religious matters. To
the priestly office of the warrior chief is added that of magician to
the extent that he can safeguard himself and his friends with magic
means against the evil designs of his enemies. Finally, in a country
where there is no supremely constituted authority with sufficient force
to remedy grievances, but only personal valor and the lance and the bolo
to appeal to, it may be expected that in the majority of cases the
warrior will assume a fourth prerogative, namely, that of chief. Thus
the warrior chief will be considered heir in his warlike character of
warrior, in his magic character as medicine man, and finally in his
political character as chief.</p>

<p>The Christian conquest of the Agúsan Valley, begun in 1877, and the
establishment of a special form of government therein in 1907, have
contributed in no small measure to diminish the number of feuds and
bloody reprisals that had given the Agúsan Valley its reputation as
&#34;the country of terror,&#34; and as a consequence leave little
opportunity for the recognition of new warriors. Thus it is that at the
present day the ancient system is fast fading away, and it is only a
matter of years before the warrior chief will be a thing of the past.</p>

<center>
<a name="3H32"></a>
<h5>INSIGNIA AND PROWESS OF THE WARRIOR CHIEF</h5>
</center>

<p>As a person of recognized prowess, the warrior chief is naturally the
leader in all warlike expeditions, and in time of peace he is looked up
to as the future defender of the settlement in which he resides.</p>

<p>Red is the distinguishing mark of the war chief's dress, which
ordinarily consists of a red headkerchief with embroidery of white,
blue, and yellow cotton at the corners, of a red jacket with similar
embroidery on the shoulders and around the back, and of long trousers,
sometimes red. His bolo is usually larger and more costly than those
carried by ordinary men and is generally of Mandáya origin. His spear,
too, is apt to be an expensive one, while his shield not infrequently is
tufted with human hair. When leading his band of braves to the attack or
during a sacrifice to his protector, the Tagbúsau, he wears his
charm-collar<sup>4</sup> with its magic herbs.<sup>5</sup> On the
warpath he binds his hair knot securely and envelops it with a rough
hewn hemisphere of wood. His influence in arranging all the details of
the plan of attack is strong, but during the attack itself he has little
control over his followers.<sup>6</sup> This might be expected from the
spirit of independence which the Manóbo displays even in the ordinary
affairs of life when not influenced by religious or other motives.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>Ta-li-hán</i>.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>These collars are often as thick as a man's arm in the
center, tapering down to the ends. They are about 75 centimeters long,
made out of cloth, and contain in sections charms made of trees, plants,
herbs, and bezoar and other magic stones, all thought to have divers
mystic powers.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>So I have been assured by many great warriors.</p>

<p>In personal valor the warrior chief invariably surpasses his fellows.
There are many who will fight face to face, especially in the upper
Sálug, Baóbo, Ihawán, and Agúsan regions. Líno and his brother, the late
Gúnlas, both of the upper Sálug, are two of the numerous examples that
might be adduced. It is true that they take no inordinate risks before
an attack, and especially where firearms are opposed to them, yet during
an attack they become desperate and will take any risk.</p>

<p>The warrior has often been branded as a traitor, a coward, and
butcher, but such an opinion, I unhesitatingly assert, is based on
ignorance and prejudice.</p>

<center>
<a name="3H33"></a>
<h5>THE WARRIOR'S TITLE TO RECOGNITION</h5>
</center>

<p>When one of the braves who accompany an expedition has killed one or
two men in fair fight he acquires the title of <i>manikiád</i> and is
entitled to wear a headkerchief striped with red and yellow. His prowess
is acknowledged, and he is considered to be so favored by the powers
above that he is looked upon as a prospective <i>bagáni</i> or warrior
chief. If during ensuing expeditions, or by ambushes, he increases to
five<sup>7</sup> the number of people whom he has killed, his position
as a full-fledged warrior is recognized, but he does not become a
warrior chief until such time as the spirits of the gods of war become
manifested in him. He is then said to be possessed,<sup>8</sup> as it
were, and it requires only a banquet to the neighboring <i>datus</i> and
warrior chiefs to confirm his title. These peculiar operations of divine
influence consist of manifestations of indescribable violence during the
attack, of eating the heart and liver of a slain enemy, and of various
other exhibitions.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>The number of killings required for promotion to the rank
of <i>bagáni</i>, or recognized warrior, varies according to the
locality.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Tag-bu-sau-án</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3H34"></a>
<h5>VARIOUS DEGREES OF WARRIOR CHIEFSHIP</h5>
</center>

<p>The rank of a warrior chief depends on the number of deaths which he
may have to his credit. There is apparently no fixed rule in this
matter, the custom of one region demanding five deaths for a certain
rank while that of another locality may require eight or only two deaths
for a similar one. From all reports made to me in nearly every district
in the middle and upper Agúsan it appears that the number of deaths
requisite in the olden days for the various degrees of warrior chiefship
was much higher than it is at present, due no doubt to the greater
frequency with which people were killed in those times. For this reason
the more recent warrior chiefs are spoken of by the older warriors as
worthless.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p><sup>9</sup><i>A-yo-á-yo</i>.</p>

<p>The following are the titles recognized by the Manóbos of the Agúsan
valley: (1) <i>hanágan</i>; (2) <i>tinabudán</i>;<sup>10</sup> (3)
<i>kinaboan</i>; (4) <i>lúto</i> or <i>linambúsan</i>; (5)
<i>lunúgum</i>; (6) <i>lípus</i>.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup><i>Tinabudán</i>, i. e., wrapped, the full expression
being &#34;<i>tinabudán to tabañg</i>,&#34; i. e., wrapped with a red
handkerchief.</p>

<p>The first title, <i>hanágan</i>, is given to one who has killed five
or more people but has not yet been admitted to the full favor of a
<i>tagbúsau</i> or blood spirit. The second title, <i>tinabudán</i>, is
given to a warrior who has made it evident that he has divine favor and
protection, made manifest in the consumption of the heart and the liver,
and who falls into a condition similar to that of the priest while in an
ecstasy. The insignia of this degree consists of a red kerchief worn
wrapped around the hair knot at the back of the head.</p>

<p>The third degree, <i>kinaboan</i>, as the word itself
indicates,<sup>11</sup> entitles the bearer to add to his apparel a red
jacket. Accounts are so various that the exact time when this title is
conferred can not be definitely stated. Thus in Umaíam I was given to
understand that 25 deaths were a sine qua non, whereas on the Kasilaían
River 6, and on the Sálug 7 deaths were reported as sufficient.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>From <i>ká-bo</i>, a jacket.</p>

<p>The fourth title, <i>lúto</i>, by its derivation means
&#34;cooked,&#34; &#34;done,&#34; &#34;finished,&#34; so that on
attaining this degree a warrior is complete, at least as far as his
raiment is concerned, for he adds a pair of red trousers. Though the
number of deaths requisite for the attainment of this degree is
variously stated as being from 50 to 100, yet I suggest 15 as being, on
the average, nearer the truth. The next degree, <i>lunúgum</i>, as the
word indicates, entitles the bearer to dress himself all in black. It is
a title acquired fortuitously, being given to one who during an attack
happened <i>to lance unknowingly a dead man in the house of the
enemy</i>. I can offer no further information on the point, except that
the recipient of this title must have been already a recognized warrior.
It seems probable that when a man commits such an act on a dead man he
is believed to be especially favored by the war gods.</p>

<p>The warrior chief who acquires the last title, <i>lípus</i>, is
supposed to have innumerable deaths to his credit, but I venture to put
50 as a safe standard of eligibility to this title. Fifty deaths
extending over a period of many years, and recounted with such additions
as a little vanity and a wine-flushed head might suggest, might easily
be converted into infinity. I know of no living warrior chief who bears
the title of <i>lípus</i>. Twenty-five deaths is the largest number
reached by any warrior with whom I am acquainted. The famous Líno of
Sálug and his brother the defunct Gúnlas, reached this rank.</p>

<center>
<a name="3H4"></a>
<h4>THE WARRIOR CHIEF IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHIEF</h4>
</center>

<p>It may be said that in nearly every case the warrior chief is the
chief of the clan or settlement. As a man of proved prowess, of
sufficient age, and with a good family following he is nearly always
recognized as the only one competent to deal with all cases that may
come up between his retainers and those of some other chief. Thus it may
be said that the Manóbo political system is a patriarchal one in which
an elder member of a family, through the respect due to his personal
prowess, age, and following, and not through any legal or hereditary
sanction adjudges such matters of dispute as inevitably arise between
his followers and those of some one else. The system is based on custom
and is carried out in a spirit of great fairness and equality.</p>

<p>The territory over which the warrior chief extends his sway is
recognized as being the collective ancestral property of the settlement.
In time of war no one except a relative is permitted to enter it under
the penalty of death, but in time of peace it lies open to all friendly
fellow tribesmen. Such matters, however, as fish poisoning<sup>12</sup>
and hunting by aliens are always interdicted.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Pag-tu-bá-han</i>.</p>

<p>Over this territory, usually occupying miles and miles of virgin
forest, lofty mountain, and fair valley, are scattered the dependents
and relatives of the warrior. It is only in times of trouble or of
expected attack that they build high houses for purposes of defense in
closer proximity to the chief. These settlements number between 20 and
200 souls, the former number being nearer the average than the
latter.</p>

<p>The attitude of the followers toward their chief is in time of peace
one of kinship feeling or one of indifference. He has practically no
authority until called upon in time of trouble to lend the weight of his
influence and the fame of his prowess. He collects no tribute and
receives no services. In every respect he does as his lowest retainer
does, hunts, fishes, etc., except that he travels more to visit friendly
neighboring chiefs, who always receive him as a guest of honor and feast
him when they have the wherewithal.</p>

<p>Various grades of chiefs are occasionally reported, such as
<i>kuyáno</i>,<sup>13</sup> <i>masikámpo</i>,<sup>14</sup> and
<i>dátu</i> but such grades do not exist. These names have probably been
conferred by mercenary Bisáyas for commercial reasons and are not
assumed by Manóbos even for purposes of ostentation.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Kuláno</i>, a title applied, I think, to Moros of the
Rio Grande of Mindanáo, and used, I have heard, by the Banuáons.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup><i>Maestre de Campo</i>--i. e., field marshal--was a
title given by the Spaniards to faithful Bukídnon chiefs.</p>

<p>The warrior chief is in almost every case the person of greatest
influence and authority, both by reason of his position in the family
and because of the prestige of his valor. In a country where the bolo
and lance are final arbiters when all else has failed the warrior must
of necessity be chief or be a person of very marked influence. If he is
not recognized as such, he generally removes himself with as many as
will or must follow to another locality, and there he becomes chief.</p>

<p>Nothing said here is intended to apply to the political organization
of the Christianized Manóbos, or <i>conquistas</i> into settlements
under the special government of the Agúsan Province. My remarks are
confined exclusively to the pagan people.</p>

<center>
<a name="3H5"></a>
<h4>THE WARRIOR CHIEF AS PRIEST AND MEDICINE MAN</h4>
</center>

<p>The reader is referred to the second part of Chapter XXIV, Part IV,
for a detailed account of the functions and prerogatives of the warrior
chief in his capacity as priest. For the present we will pass on to
consider him in his role of medicine man, summarizing briefly his magic
methods for the cure of various ailments ascribed to supernatural
agency.</p>

<p>As to the warrior's knowledge and powers in both capacities, I have
always found the many warrior chiefs with whom I have come in contact
very reticent and have accordingly been unable to secure detailed
information on this subject. It is beyond a doubt, however, that great
powers are attributed to them both in causing and curing certain
ailments.</p>

<p>It may be said that any disease attributed to the displeasure of the
blood spirits falls within their jurisdiction as priests and may be
cured by a sacrifice or by other ceremonial methods. As a general rule
they are supposed to have a knowledge of various magic and medicinal
herbs. They are always the possessors of necklaces,<sup>15</sup> to
which are attributed such powers as those of imparting invisibility and
invulnerability. These peculiar charms, as well as numerous herbs,
roots, and other things possessing magic power for good and for evil,
are often bound up in the charm collars and can not be seen. Nothing
will prevail upon the owner to declare even their names. After opening
the breast of the slain enemies they dip these mystic collars in the
blood and thereby, through the instrumentality of their blood spirits,
impart to the collars greater potency.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup><i>Ta-li-hán</i>.</p>

<p>Hemorrhages and all wounds or other troubles in which a flux of blood
appears are thought to emanate from the desire of the familiars of the
warrior priests for blood. Hence he is called upon to make intercession
and to propitiate<sup>16</sup> these bloodthirsty spirits with the
sacrifice of a pig or fowl. After the pig has been killed, a little of
the blood is caught in a split bamboo receptacle,<sup>17</sup> which is
then hung up in the house with the blood left in it for the regalement
of these insatiate spirits.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup><i>Dá-yo to tag-búsau</i>.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup><i>Bin-u-ká</i>.</p>

<p>Besides curative means the warrior medicine man is said to have
secret means of causing bodily harm to those against whom he feels a
grievance. These means are called <i>kometán</i> and have been described
in Chapter XV. It is true that others are reputed to have these secret
magic means, but none except the warrior priest will make open
confession of their reputed powers.</p>

<center>
<a name="3I"></a>
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>
<h3>POLITICAL ORGANIZATION: WAR, ITS ORIGIN, INCEPTION, COURSE, AND
TERMINATION</h3>

<a name="3I1"></a>
<h4>MILITARY AFFAIRS IN GENERAL</h4>
</center>

<p>There exists no military organization in Manóboland, no standing
army, no reviews, no conscription. The whole male circle of relatives
and such others as desire to take part, either for friendship's sake or
for the glory and spoil, form the war party. There is no punishment for
failure to join an expedition but as blood is thicker than water, the
nearer male relatives always take part and there are never wanting
others who either bear a grudge against the author of the grievance or
go for the emolument that they may receive or even for the sport and the
spoil of it. It is customary to bring along such male slaves as may be
depended upon to render faithful and efficient work. It is only fear of
incurring enmity that holds back the majority of those who do not take
part. I here desire, to impress upon my readers one important point in
the Manóbo's idea of war, and it is this: <i>That no blame is laid upon
nor resentment harbored toward anyone who joins an expedition as a paid
warrior</i>.<sup>1</sup> I have ascertained beyond reasonable doubt,
after continual questioning on my part and open unsolicited avowals on
the part of others, that warrior chiefs are frequently paid to redress a
wrong in which they have no personal concern.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Sin-nó-ho</i>.</p>

<p>In the case of ordinary tribesmen, I know that where personal
feelings and the hope of material advantages are not an inducement to
partake in the expedition, they are frequently tempted with an offer of
some such thing as a fine bolo or a lance, to lend their services to the
leader of the war party. It is needless to say that only close ties of
friendship or relationship to the enemy prevent the offer from being
accepted, <i>especially as the acceptance of it relieves the Manóbo from
all responsibility for such deaths as may accrue to his credit during
the prospective encounter</i>. When, however, previous feuds, or other
unfriendly antecedents existed between the warrior and his opponent, the
acceptance of a remuneration for his participation in the fray would not
shield him from the dire vengeance that would, sooner or later, surely
follow.</p>

<p>For a description of the weapons used and of the manner of using
them, the reader is referred to Chapter XI.</p>

<p>In the description of the Manóbo house (Chapter V), reference was
made to the high houses erected for defense when an unusual attack is
expected. Tree houses, at the time I left the valley, were very few and
far between, even in the eastern Cordillera and at the headwaters of the
Tágo River.</p>

<p>Besides building high houses and resorting to devices referred to in
Chapter V, the Manóbos occasionally slash down the surrounding forest in
such a way as to form a veritable abatis of timber.</p>

<p>In one place I saw a very unique and effective form of defense. A
fence surrounded the house. To gain access to the latter it was
necessary to ascend a notched pole about 2 meters high and then to pass
along two horizontal bamboo poles about 10 meters long. Numerous deadly
bamboo caltrops bristled out of the ground underneath the precarious
bamboo bridge that led to a platform whence the house could be reached
only by climbing the usual notched pole. Whosoever ventured to cross
this perilous bridge, would certainly meet death from one source or
another, either from the hurtling shower of arrows from above or from
the bristling caltrops below.</p>

<center>
<a name="3I2"></a>
<h4>THE ORIGIN OF WAR</h4>
</center>

<p>Fighting arises from one or more of the following causes: Vendettas,
sexual infringements, debts, and sometimes from a system of private
seizure, by which the property or life of an innocent third party is
taken. The Manóbo expresses the same thing in a simpler way by saying
that war has its origin in two things, namely &#34;debt (blood debt
included) and deceit.&#34; It has been said that glory and the capture
of slaves are the springs of war in Manóboland, but this, in my opinion,
is not true. Nor will I concede that war is undertaken for merely
religious reasons. It is my belief, verified by numerous observations
made during several years of intimate dealing with Manóbos throughout
eastern Mindanáo, that fighting or killing takes place in order to
redress a wrong or to collect a debt, whether it be of blood or of
anything else. It is true that many who have no grievance, take part
merely for the sport, the spoil, and the glory of it, but in no case
that I know of was there wanting on the part of those who inaugurated
the war a real and reasonable motive. I have heard of cases of unjust
warfare but my informants were enemies of the parties against whom they
complained and most probably were calumniating them.</p>

<h5>VENDETTAS</h5>
</center>

<p>Vendettas, which exist in many more enlightened countries of the
world, are the most common cause of war, or it would be better to say,
of the continuance of war.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, in my mind, but that the whole eastern quarter of
Mindanáo would flame out into interclan warfare, were it not for the
efficient form of government now established there. I can bear witness
to this fact, as I was cognizant of various raids that took place from
1905 to 1907 and of the fact that they were much less frequent from the
close of 1907 till my departure from the Agúsan Valley in 1910.</p>

<p>As in other countries, so in Manóboland, not only is the vendetta
regarded as legitimate but it is considered the duty of every relative
of the slain to seek revenge for his death. Living in a state of
absolute independence from the restraints of outside government, as they
had been up to the beginning of the Christian conquest in 1877, the
Manóbos, according to their own accounts, passed a very unquiet
existence. On account of blood feuds, most of them lived in tree houses
built in lofty inaccessible places, as I have been repeatedly told by
old men. I have been assured that if ever the Americans leave the
valley, old blood scores will be settled, even should it be necessary
&#34;to do without salt.&#34;<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><sup>2</sup>The enjoyment of salt seems to be, in the Manóbo's
estimation, one of the greatest blessings, if not the greatest, that he
has derived from civilization. Yet he would be willing to forego the use
of it, if it were possible for him to take revenge upon the slayers of
his relatives.</p>

<p>The vendetta system was so prevalent during my first travels in
eastern Mindanáo that on one occasion a Manóbo of the Tágo River
inquired of me whether there were any living relatives of a certain
Manóbo of the upper Argáwan who had killed his grandfather. Upon
learning that there were, he forthwith besought me to accompany him in a
raid against the relatives of his grandfather's murderers.</p>

<p>Another instance will show the persistency with which the idea of
revenge is entertained. I noticed in a house on the Wá-wa River a strong
rattan vine strung taut from a rafter to one of the floor joists. My
host, the owner of the house, waxed over-merry in his cups and was
descanting on his valiant feats in the pre-American days. He suddenly
jumped up and twanged the rattan, intimating that he might yet be able
to take revenge on a certain enemy of his but that if he were unable to
do it, his son after him would strive to fulfill his teaching and that
in any case vengeance would be had before the vine rotted. Anyone
familiar with the rattan knows its durability, when protected from the
influences of the sun and rain.</p>

<p>This practice of stretching a green rattan in some part of the house
and of vowing vengeance &#34;till it rot&#34; is not uncommon, and is an
indication of the deep, eternal desire for vengeance so characteristic
of the Manóbos.</p>

<p>Another practice, also indicative of the vendetta system, is the
bequeathing from father to son<sup>3</sup> of the duty of seeking
revenge. I have never been present at the ceremony but have heard over
and over again that so-and-so received the inheritance and must endeavor
to carry out the dying behest of his father or other relative. One man,
who had received this &#34;teaching,&#34; on being questioned as to
whether he would like to make peace with his enemy, seemed shocked and
vehemently protested, saying, &#34;It can't be done, it can't be done,
it is tabooed;&#34; he then went on to upbraid me soundly for the
suggestion.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>It is called <i>ka-tud-li-án</i>.</p>

<p>In some cases, the task of revenge is turned over to a third party,
who has no personal interest in the feud. As explained to me, such a
person is in a better position to attack the enemy than one whose duty
it is. In case he succeeds in getting revenge, no blame, I was assured,
is attached to him, as he is regarded in the light of a paid warrior or
mercenary. Such an institution as this of the vendetta together with the
system of private seizure render life in Manóboland very hazardous, and
serve to explain the extreme caution and forbearance exhibited by one
Manóbo toward another in the most trivial concerns of life.</p>

<center>
<a name="3I22"></a>
<h5>PRIVATE SEIZURE<sup>4</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>Tau-a-gán</i>.</p>

<p>The practice of private seizure is a very peculiar one, according to
our way of thinking, yet it is universal among the tribes of eastern
Mindanáo. As long as it is confined to material things, it is not
ordinarily a cause for war, but when practiced on a human being, it
frequently results in retaliation in kind.</p>

<p>The practice consists in seizing the property of a third, frequently
a neutral, party, as a &#34;call&#34; on the debtor. For example, A owes
B a slave and for one reason or another has been unable or unwilling to
pay his debt. B has exhibited a sufficient amount of patience, while at
the same time he has used every means to bring pressure to bear upon A.
Finally, despairing of collecting in an amicable way, and, most
probably, suspecting that his debtor is playing with him, he seizes a
relative or a slave or a pig of C as a &#34;call&#34; to A. C thus pays
A's debt and then takes measures to collect from him, the understanding
being that B is to take all responsibility for the consequences.</p>

<p>This system seldom gives rise to a blood feud except when blood has
been shed. Thus in the above instance, had B killed C, as a summons to
A, a feud would almost infallibly have followed. Yet C's relatives might
have been willing to accept a money compensation from B, and might have
come to an agreement whereby they would jointly operate against A in
order to avenge the death of C.</p>

<p>I witnessed a case in which the seizure of a pig was the origin of a
bloody feud that had not ended at the time of my departure from the
upper Agúsan. As the individuals involved in the case are still living
their names will be represented by letters.</p>

<p>A had been fined P15 because his wife had made the statement that B
had knowledge of a secret or magic<sup>5</sup> poison. C who was a
relative of A and already owed B to the amount of P15, with the consent
of all parties concerned, assumed the responsibility of paying A's debt,
thereby putting himself in debt to B to the amount of one slave (at
P30). Now some of C's relatives had certain little claims against some
of B's relatives and thought it a good opportunity to collect their own
dues and to diminish their kinsman's debt by presenting their claims for
payment. B refused to pay on the ground that his kinsfolk and not
himself were responsible for the settlement of said claims, whereupon C
refused to deliver his slave till the payment to his relatives was
forthcoming.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup><i>Ko-me-tán</i>.</p>

<p>The matter thus lingered for several months until B, who owed a slave
to another party, and was pressed for payment thought it time to force
matters, and, in company with three relatives, seized A's sow as a
&#34;call&#34; on C.</p>

<p>The result of this was that after a few weeks B's wife and another
woman were speared to death in a <i>camote</i> patch, and in revenge B
took the lives of two of C's party. I made every possible effort to have
the matter adjudicated in an informal way but neither party seemed to be
anxious to come to terms.</p>

<p>Owing to this system of private seizure, a party of warriors
returning from an unsuccessful raid are considered dangerous, and
settlements on their trail put themselves in a state of
watchfulness,<sup>6</sup> for when returning without having secured a
victim the party might be incited to make a seizure in order to avoid
thereby the derision of their enemies.</p>

<h5>DEBTS AND SEXUAL INFRINGEMENTS</h5>
</center>

<p>Long-continued failure to pay a debt is very frequently the remote
cause of war. This is easy to understand if we consider the sacredness
with which debts are regarded in Manóboland. An excessive delay in
meeting obligations gives rise to hot and hasty words on the part of the
creditor; the debtor takes umbrage and retorts, a quarrel with bolos
ensues, thereby giving rise to a feud that, under favorable conditions,
may continue for generations with its fierce mutual reprisals. A feature
that serves to increase the number of these financial bickerings is the
fact that questions of indebtedness are almost invariably discussed
while drinking is going on and as a result, according to an immemorial
rule the world over, the creditor frequently indulges in
personalities.</p>

<p>Sexual infringements are a cause of war. Only one case passed under
my personal notice but instances of olden days were related to me. There
is no doubt in my mind as to the result of a serious sexual misdemeanor;
it is death by the lance or the bolo for the offender without much
parleying, if one may give credence to the universal outspoken Manóbo
opinion on the subject.</p>

<center>
<a name="3I3"></a>
<h4>INCEPTION OF WAR</h4>

<a name="3I31"></a>
<h5>DECLARATION OF WAR</h5>
</center>

<p>No heralds go forth to announce to the enemy the coming conflict. On
the contrary, the greatest secrecy is maintained. If the grievance is a
sudden and serious one, such as the death of a clansman, a set of
ambushers may be dispatched at the earliest moment that the omens are
found favorable. Or it may be decided to attack the settlement of the
enemy in full force. If the latter decision is reached, a party is sent
out to reconnoiter the place of attack. All information possible is
obtained from neighbors of the enemy, and, if the reconnaissance shows
conditions favorable for an attack, the march is begun in due form.
Should the reconnoitering party, however, report unfavorably, the attack
is put off until, after weeks, months, or years of patient, but close,
vigilance and inquiry, a favorable opportunity presents itself.</p>

<p>Sometimes a bolder warrior chief who has a personal grievance may
send a war message in the shape of a fighting-bolo,<sup>7</sup> or of a
lance with an abusive challenge, but this is rare, as far as I have been
able to ascertain. It is common, however, for the more famed war chiefs
to keep their personal enemies on the <i>qui-vive</i>, by periodic
threats. &#34;I will begin my march 10 nights from now,&#34; &#34;I will
reap his rice,&#34; &#34;I will eat his heart and liver,&#34; &#34;He
won't be able to sow rice for four years,&#34; &#34;I need his wife to
plant my <i>camotes</i>&#34;--are samples of the messages that reach a
clansman and keep him and his family on some mountain pinnacle for many
a long year till such time as the threat is carried out and the posts of
his house, all wreathed with secondary growth, tell the grim tale of
revenge. I have seen such posts scattered over the face of eastern
Mindanáo--a memory of the dead.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>Li-kúd-lí-kud</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3I32"></a>
<h5>TIME FOR WAR</h5>
</center>

<p>The usual time for war is either on the occasion of death in the
family or at the time of the harvest season. The former is selected both
to soften, by the joy of victory, the sorrow felt for the loss of a dear
relative, and to check the jubilation that the enemy would naturally
feel and frequently express on such an occasion. The latter is chosen
for the purpose of destroying the enemy's rice crop or at least of
making it difficult for him to harvest it.</p>

<p>War is undertaken at other times also. Thus a sudden and grievous
provocation would cause an expedition to start just as soon as the
necessary number of warriors could be assembled, and a favorable
combination of omens obtained.</p>

<p>It often happens, I have been told over and over again, that when an
attack proves unsuccessful, those who repelled the attack set out at
once to surprise their enemies by a shower of arrows while the latter
are returning to their homes, or, if possible, reach the settlement
before them and massacre the defenseless women and children.</p>

<center>
<a name="3I33"></a>
<h5>PREPARATIONS FOR WAR</h5>
</center>

<p>The remote preparations for war consist in locating the house of the
enemy and in getting all information, even the minutest, as to the
trails, position of traps and bamboo spears. All this must be done
through a third party, preferably someone who has a grievance to
satisfy, and may require months or even years, for the Manóbo is a
cautious fighter and will take no unnecessary risks. During all this
time the aggrieved party is enlisting, in a quiet, diplomatic way, the
good will of as many as he can trust. If he has no recognized warrior
chief on his side he must by all means secure the services of at least
one, even though it should be necessary to offer him a material
compensation and in divers other ways gain his good will and
cooperation.</p>

<p>The immediate preparations consist in sending out a few of the
nearest male relatives several days or even a week before the intended
attack to reconnoiter the settlement of the enemy. On the return of this
party word is sent to those who have agreed to join the expedition and a
day and place are appointed for meeting. A pig and a supply of rice are
procured and on the appointed day the relatives and friends of the
leader assemble at the trysting place, which was, in nearly every
instance that I witnessed or heard of, a house somewhat remote from the
settlement.</p>

<p>With a warrior chief for officiant certain religious
rites<sup>8</sup> are performed. The pig is partaken of in the usual
style and, if the omens are favorable, all is ready. But should the
omens portend evil, the expedition is put off to a more auspicious
occasion. In one instance that passed under my personal observation the
departure of the warriors was postponed for several days by reason of
inauspicious omens. I have heard of some cases in which the war party
returned after several days' march in order to await more reassuring
signs of success.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>See Pt. IV, Ch. XXVI.</p>

<p>No particular demonstrations of sorrow are manifested by the women
when the war party sets out. Revenge is of more importance than love.
Moreover, it is seldom that the casualties on the side of the aggressors
amount to more than one, so that no fear is entertained and all are
sanguine as to the outcome, for have not the omens been consulted and
have they not portended so many deaths and so many captives?</p>

<p>The band glides off silently and stealthily into the forest. A war
chief, if one has been willing to join the expedition, usually leads,
accompanied, it is believed, by his invisible war deities. A little
ahead, just the distance of a whisper, the Manóbos say, strides
Mandayáñgan, the giant and the hero of the old, old days. All ears are
alert for the turtledove's cry, and when its prophetic voice is heard,
every arm is up and points with closed fist in the direction of it. But
it is only its direction with regard to the leader that is considered.
If this is unfavorable, the march is discontinued till the next day,
but, if favorable, the party proceeds, selecting, as much as possible,
tortuous and seldom trodden trails.</p>

<p>The following are some of the taboos that must be observed by the
party while en route.</p>

<p>(1) They may speak to no one met on the trail.</p>

<p>(2) Nothing once taken in the hand may be thrown away until night or
until arriving at the enemies' settlement. Thus a piece of a branch
caught in the hand and broken off accidentally must be retained.</p>

<p>(3) They may eat nothing that is found on the trail. Thus killing
game is prohibited. I heard of one man who had been wounded in an ambush
arranged by the enemy on the trail. He assured me that his ill luck was
due to his having taken a fish dropped by a fish eagle.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p><sup>9</sup><i>Man-dá-git</i>.</p>

<p>(4) The food taken on the trail must be placed upon one shield,
preferably that of the leader, and thence distributed to the members of
the party.</p>

<p>(5) The wives of the warriors are forbidden to indulge in unnecessary
shouting and noise, and to remain within the house as far as possible
till the return of their husbands.</p>

<p>(6) No cooking may be done on the trail till the settlement of the
enemy is reached. This does not mean that food may not be cooked in a
house along the trail. On the contrary, I was assured that on a long
trip it is customary to call at the house of some friendly person and to
make a sacrifice, at the same time taking further observations from the
intestines of the victim. I was an eyewitness of this proceeding on one
occasion and did not fail to observe also with what relish the war party
replenished the inner man.</p>

<p>Besides taboos, there are a number of evil omens that must be guarded
against. Thus, if a snake were to cross the path, or any insect such as
a bee or a scorpion were to bite or sting one of the party, the return
of the whole number would be necessary unless they were too far advanced
already. In the latter case other omens must be consulted, and, when it
is felt that these new omens have neutralized the effect of the previous
ones, the march may be continued. Owing to the observance and
reobservance of omens it is obvious that great delays are occasioned and
at times the expedition is stopped. On the one that I accompanied in
1907, the turtledove gave a cry, the direction of which was considered
to portend neither good nor evil, and the leader expressed his opinion
at the time that the object of the expedition would not be attained. He
was overruled, however, by the consensus of opinion of his companions,
and the march was resumed. Notwithstanding the fact that ensuing signs
all proved favorable, yet as I observed very clearly, the first omen had
depressed the spirits of the party. When my efforts to settle the
dispute without a fight failed, and an open attack was decided upon,
there seemed to be no morale in the party, and the attack was abandoned
without any special reason. This instance will serve to show the
uncompromising faith of the Manóbo in omens, especially in that of the
turtledove.</p>

<p>There is one omen of a peculiar nature that is of singular importance
while on the warpath. On such a journey red pepper and ginger are
consumed in considerable quantities for the purpose, it is said, of
increasing one's courage. Naturally, no matter how accustomed one may
have become to these spices, he always feels their piquancy to a certain
extent, so that the warrior who fails to become aware of a sharp biting
taste, regards this as an ill omen and, though he accompanies his
fellows to the scene of combat, takes no part in the attack.</p>

<p>It is usual, as was said before, to stop over at a friendly house
nearest to that of the enemy and to send forward a few of the band to
make another reconnaissance but, if no house is available, a stop is
made anywhere. A reason for this is that they may arrive near the
settlement at nightfall or during the night.</p>

<p>When the party arrives within a few miles of the actual ascent to the
mountain where the enemy's house is situated, a halt is again made in a
concealed position and a few of the more experienced warriors advance at
dusk on the trail to the house. If the enemy has been in a state of
constant vigilance, this undertaking is one of extreme difficulty. The
house is on the top of a lofty hill and frequently access can not be had
to it except by passing through a series of swamps. In addition one must
climb up precipitous ascents, and break through a network of felled
trees and such other obstacles as the reader can readily imagine for
himself. There is, moreover, the danger from spring traps set both for
man and animal, and from sharp bamboo slivers placed all around the
house and on the trails. Thus a fair idea can be obtained of the
difficulties that are encountered by those who, in the silence and
darkness of the night, inform themselves of all that is necessary for a
successful attack. After going around the house and unspringing traps
and removing sufficient of the bamboo slivers to afford a safe passage,
the scouts return to the camp and a whispered consultation takes place.
Positions are assigned to each man and a general plan of attack is made.
Then, groping along in the gloom of the night, with never a sound but
that of their own stumbling steps, they put themselves in position
around the settlement and await with bated[sic] breath the break of
day.</p>

<center>
<a name="3I4"></a>
<h4>THE ATTACK</h4>

<a name="3I41"></a>
<h5>TIME AND METHODS OF ATTACK</h5>
</center>

<p>The break of day is selected as the hour for the attack because sleep
is then thought to be soundest and the drowsiness and sluggishness
following the awakening to be greater. Moreover, at that time there is
sufficient light to enable the attacking party to see their opponents
whether they fight or flee.</p>

<p>The number of combatants depends entirely on the strength and
position of the enemy. As a rule as many as possible are enlisted for an
expedition where the enemy has numerical strength and a strong position.
In the expedition which I accompanied in 1907, the party numbered some
60. I have heard of war parties that numbered 150.</p>

<p>When the house or houses of the enemy are low, the aggressors steal
up noiselessly and, breaking out into the dismal war cry,<sup>10</sup>
drive their lances through the floor or through the sides of the house,
if it is low enough. They then retire and by listening and questioning
ascertain whether any of the inmates still survive. If any remain alive
they are to surrender.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup><i>Pa-nad-jáu-an</i>.</p>

<p>When, however, the settlement is a large one, consisting of one or
more high houses, the matter is a more difficult one. The aggressors
advance to the house and if the floor is out of reach of their lances
one or more of the bolder ones may quietly climb up the posts and after
dispatching one or more of the inmates with a few thrusts hurriedly
slide down to the ground. Then the war cry is called out to increase the
consternation that has begun to reign in the house. If the enemy is
known to have a large stock of arrows the aggressors retire and allow
them to expend part of their supply.</p>

<p>No unnecessary risks are taken in fighting. When the male portion of
the enemy are considered capable of making a stand, the house is not
approached but a battle of arrows takes place, the aggressors advancing
to entice the enemy to shoot, while their bowmen, usually only a few in
number, reply. During all this time there is a bandying of hot words,
threats, and imprecations on both sides. &#34;I'll have your hair,&#34;
&#34;I'll eat your liver,&#34; &#34;I'll sacrifice your son,&#34;
&#34;Your wife will get my water,&#34; are a few of the expressions that
are used. The drum and gong in the house may be beaten all this time as
a signal of distress to call such relatives or friends as may live
within hearing distance. The priestesses of the attacked party may go
through a regular sacrifice if there is a chicken or a pig in the house,
beseeching their deities to protect them in this the hour of danger.</p>

<p>When the arrows of the enemy are thought to be expended, the
attacking party try by means of a burning arrow to fire the roof. Should
this succeed, the inmates are doomed, for when they escape from the
house the enemy close in upon them, and kill with lances or bolos, men
and women, whether married or single. As a rule, only the children are
spared.</p>

<p>Should the roof, however, fail to catch fire another means of attack
is employed. Putting their shields upon their heads in a formation much
like the old Roman testudo, they advance to the house in bodies of four
or six and begin to hack down the posts. But here again they may be
foiled, for it has happened that the inmates of the house were provided
with a supply of big stones, or had a little boiling water on hand, and
made their opponents retire out of fear of the arrows that would be sure
to follow when the stones had broken the arrangement of their shields.
Moreover, the ordinary Manóbo, who has lived in expectation of an attack
sooner or later, has his house set on a number of posts varying from 12
to 20. No little time would be required to cut these and the aggressors
would be in danger of receiving wounds and thereby bringing the attack
to an end, <i>for it is the invariable practice for the party to retire
after one of its members has been wounded or slain</i>. The reason for
this custom I am unable to state. There occurred on the Argáwan in 1907
an instance which I verified, and in the various accounts of Manóbo
fighting that I received all over the Agúsan Valley, there were numerous
instances of the observance of this custom.</p>

<p>In besieging the house, which may not be captured for several days,
either firewood, food, or water may give out quickly, and the besieged
succumb to hunger, or to thirst. In their last extremity they make a
dash for liberty, especially during the night, and, though many of them
fall victims, not a few frequently save themselves.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I was told, the besieged rush forward and meet death
fighting. Again the men are said to kill their wives and children with
their own hands, and then to go forth to meet the enemy. Father Urios,
S. J., makes mention of a case of this kind.</p>

<p>As to the number of slain, and of captives, it depends on the size of
the settlement. In an instance which I verified on the Húlip River,
upper Agúsan, some 190 souls perished in one attack. Though this number
seems large, yet it goes to show that on occasions raids are made on a
somewhat larger scale than might be expected.</p>

<p>As each one of the attacking party strikes down the victim that falls
in his way he notifies his companions of the fact by a fierce yell,
calling out at the same time the name of his victim. This is to avoid
disputes later and to secure the credit for the killing. Though the
killing of a woman does not entitle the warrior to any special title,
yet it adds one to his glory list and is supposed to make him more apt
to fall into the favor of a war deity. It is said that in the confusion
of the flight many women meet their end but that a good many remain in
the houses and yield themselves to the mercy of their captors. Some of
these, especially the younger ones, are bound with rattan, if they offer
resistance and dragged to the settlement of their captors.</p>

<p>As soon as it is ascertained that there is no one left to offer
resistance the warriors adorn their lances with leaves of <i>palma
brava</i> or such other palm fronds as may be found in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Many warrior chiefs, especially of the Debabáon<sup>11</sup> group,
have described the fight to me and all agree that it is generally of
short duration. This might be expected from the number of precautions
taken to insure success. According to all reports a strongly entrenched
enemy is seldom attacked, unless it is ascertained that a goodly portion
of the male members are absent.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>Babáo is the district between the Sálug and Libagánon
Rivers.</p>

<p>As a resume of the method of attack, based on what I learned during
my sojourn among the Manóbos, I may say that there are no general nor
partial encounters. The house or the settlement is surrounded stealthily
just before day, the warriors being spread out at intervals in bands of
three or four around the settlement and protected if possible by trees.
The leader, who is nearly always a warrior chief, takes up his position
with some trusty warriors at the place of closest approach to the house,
or at some other strategic point. The arrowmen, who number only a few,
are stationed near him. They work at a disadvantage for they have to
shoot upward while their opponents in the houses can discharge their
arrows downward.</p>

<p>From these positions the attacking party make every effort to cause a
panic among the inmates of the house either by chopping down the posts
which support the house or by firing the roof. If either purpose is
accomplished the besieged rush forth only to meet the point of the lance
or the edge of the bolo.</p>

<p>There are no preconcerted movements, no combinations with centers,
wings, and reserves. The chief has little or no influence with his
followers during the fight, though on account of his personal prowess he
is looked up to as a pillar of strength and would, no doubt, if given
the opportunity, or if the abuse and banter were extreme, engage in a
hand-to-hand encounter. Numerous cases of this kind are on record.</p>

<p>No women nor priests take part in the attack. There are no orators to
inspire the warriors to deeds of valor. In lieu of oratory, the warriors
on each side engage in the most ferocious abuse imaginable. Challenge
after challenge is yelled out defiantly by the besiegers. In the
expedition which I joined in 1907, the attacking party incessantly
defied their enemies to come down, while the latter in return challenged
the besiegers to approach. Neither party seemed willing to take the risk
so the arrowmen plied their arrows, the priestesses in the houses
continued their invocations, and everybody howled challenges and
imprecations at everybody else.</p>

<h4>EVENTS FOLLOWING THE BATTLE</h4>

<a name="3I51"></a>
<h5>CELEBRATION OF THE VICTORY</h5>
</center>

<p>After the fight is over the warrior chiefs perform a ceremony of
which I have been able to learn but few details. They are said to become
possessed by their tutelary war spirits. They dance and jump around the
lifeless body of their chief enemy.<sup>12</sup> After performing their
dance they open the breast of the enemy and remove the heart and liver,
and place their charm collars<sup>13</sup> in the opening. When the
heart and liver have been cooked, they consume them. But as several war
chiefs have assured me, it is not they that partake of the flesh, but
their protecting deities. Be that as it may, lemon<sup>14</sup> whenever
obtainable, is mixed with the gory viands. Some warriors informed me
that their deities preferred the heart and liver raw.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>Their tongues are said to loll out of their mouths
&#34;one palm-length.&#34; This may seem somewhat exaggerated but I can
throw no further light on the matter.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Ta-li-hán</i>.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup><i>Sú-ái</i>. It is interesting to note the frequency of
the use of lemons or limes in religious proceedings.</p>

<p>It is perfectly legitimate to despoil the enemy's house and to bear
away such few valuables as may be found. The house, or houses, are then
burnt, and the victors, leaving the slain where they fell, hasten back
with their captives to cheer the fond ones at home.<sup>15</sup></p>

<p><sup>15</sup>I have heard it said that the bodies of the slain are
doubled up and put into holes in the ground in an upright position. As
far as I know this is an exceptional proceeding.</p>

<p>It is said that, as a rule, the aggressors are victorious, for rarely
do they attack an enemy that is too strongly entrenched. They prefer to
wait, even for years, till an occasion favorable in time, place, and
circumstances, presents itself. It is only under special provocation,
such as continual attacks by their enemy, that they attack him while he
is in a strong position and then more with a view to destroying his
crops than with the hope of securing a victim.</p>

<center>
<a name="3I52"></a>
<h5>THE CAPTURE OF SLAVES</h5>
</center>

<p>The capture of slaves is one of the important features of the
expedition. A slave becomes the property of the captor, although a
certain number are very frequently given in payment to the warrior chief
or chiefs who were engaged to help the raiding party. This number
depends on a previous agreement. The age of the captive decides whether
he or she will be taken into captivity or slain on the spot. As a rule,
all but children under the age of puberty are despatched[sic] there and
then as they are liable to escape sooner or later if taken captive.
However, I was assured by several warrior chiefs that the better looking
unmarried girls are not killed, but are kept to be married, or to be
retailed in marriage, thereby bringing a handsome remuneration to the
owner. It must not be supposed by the reader that this implies anything
inconsistent with sexual morality, for these female slaves are treated
with as much delicacy as if they were the captor's daughters. To the
numerous inquiries that I made on this point, there was only one
reply--that sexual intercourse with them was foul and would make the
offender <i>ga-bá-an</i>.<sup>16</sup> A warrior who would be guilty of
violating this taboo would never, it is thought, attain the rank of
warrior chief. Should anyone of the warriors desire to marry his captive
he must go through a purificatory<sup>17</sup> process, the details of
which I am unable to furnish.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>I have never yet been able to grasp the significance of
this word. It is used by Bisáyas in the form <i>hi-ga-bá'-an</i>, which
has apparently a very similar meaning.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup><i>Hú-gad</i>.</p>

<p>The above taboo goes even further. Not only is the person of the
living female captives to be respected but also that of the dead, in so
far as it-is considered improper to remove from their persons any object
such as bracelets or hair. Men's bodies, however, are rifled of
everything, even their hair, and are then unmercifully hacked and
hewn.</p>

<center>
<a name="3I6"></a>
<h4>THE RETURN OF THE WARRIORS</h4>
</center>

<p>If the war party is unsuccessful, they return hastily and cautiously.
It frequently happens that the enemy take a short cut, being better
acquainted with the geography of the region, and lay an ambush at a
suitable point. For this reason a close watch is kept on the return
home; a few warriors take the lead, and where a beaten trail is
followed, a few keep guard on each side at a distance of several yards,
to avoid falling into an ambush. When the party arrive at their
settlement each repairs to his own house. A thousand and one reasons are
assigned for failure, but never is it attributed to a falseness of the
omens--anything but that. Should the band, however, have been
victorious, or have brought about the death of the chief enemy at least,
no words can describe their joy and jubilation. The woods reecho with
their wild screams and the weird ululations of the battle cry. Each one
provides himself with a bamboo trumpet and makes the forest resound with
its deep boom. The captives that offer any resistance, are dragged
along, or even killed, if they become too troublesome. Upon nearing a
friendly settlement the din is redoubled and the whole settlement turns
out to welcome the victors. But when their home settlement is reached
the scene is indescribable. I witnessed an occasion of this kind. Before
the party came into sight the bamboo trumpets could be heard, first
faintly and then increasing in strength. As soon as the expectant women
and the few men who had remained in the village had satisfied themselves
that their relatives and friends were returning, drums and gongs were
beaten in answer. The young men and boys rushed out and crossing the
river on their rafts or in their boats dashed into the forest to meet
the conquerors. Even the women became hilarious and gave vent to loud
cries. For a few minutes before the appearance of the party the war cry
could be heard and when they came into view on the other side of the
river the din was indescribable. The gong and drum were brought down to
the bank and the war tattoo was beaten. The clanging of the gong, the
rolling of the drum, the booming of the trumpets, the ululation of the
war cry, and the lusty yells and shrieks of joy, welcome, and inquiry
produced a pandemonium that baffles description. Before the victors
crossed the river they all took a bath,<sup>18</sup> not for sanitary
but for ceremonial reasons. The bath is thought to have a purificatory
effect in that it removes the evil influence<sup>19</sup> of death.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>This is an invariable custom, I was told.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup><i>Bá-ho</i>, literally foul smell.</p>

<p>When the victors had crossed the river they removed the palm
fronds<sup>20</sup> with which they had adorned their lances and put
them on the necks and heads of their wives and friends. Later on a
banquet was prepared and the reader is left to conceive for himself the
revels that followed. It is said that not infrequently at this time some
of the captives are given to the unsuccessful warriors for immediate
slaughter. That this has occurred I have absolutely no reason to doubt,
and every reason to believe. I have heard many describe among themselves
how it was done, and what joy it gave them to be able to take revenge
upon one of their hereditary enemies.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>Called <i>Ma-yún-hau</i>. It is said that these are
frequently stained with the blood of the slain.</p>

<center>
<a name="3I7"></a>
<h4>AMBUSHES AND OTHER METHODS OF WARFARE</h4>
</center>

<p>Ambush<sup>21</sup> is a legitimate method of warfare, according to
Manóbo customs. It consists in locating one's self with one or more
companions at a place which the enemy is expected to pass. A favorite
place for the ambush is on the trail between the enemy's house and his
rice or <i>camote</i> field, but a spot on a river bank or at any
suitable point may be selected. Great precautions are taken by putting
up screens of leaves to prevent the enemy from discovering the ambush.
This is always made on the right hand<sup>22</sup> and very frequently
there is a supply of sticks and stones in readiness. The position on the
right hand is chosen because it gives those in wait an opportunity to
deal a blow on the weaker side of the enemy, all of whom carry the
shield in the left hand.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup><i>Báñg-an</i>.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>Right hand refers to the right hand of the party to be
attacked.</p>

<p>It is customary to take an ear or the right forearm of one slain in
ambush as a proof of his death if the conditions of the ambush require
such a proof. An instance occurred during my first visit to the upper
Agúsan in 1907. Three Mañgguáñgans were ambushed by a mixed group of
Manóbos and Debabáons, and the above-mentioned parts of their bodies
were taken by the victors to their clans as a proof of the killing.</p>

<p>After a rupture between two parties, one or both of them go into a
state which is expressed by the word <i>láma</i>. This signifies that
one or both of them abandons his homestead and transfers himself and the
members of his household (usually a few brothers-in-law with their
families) to some place difficult of access. If the house can be built
on a bluff, or a hill that is approachable from only one or two sides,
so much the better. On such a site a house<sup>23</sup> is built varying
from 5 meters to 8 meters in height, sometimes, though rarely nowadays,
being built upon a tree trunk. The felled timber at the edge of the
forest is left unburned. Bamboo or <i>palma brava</i> caltrops are
placed in the encircling forest. In addition to these, spring
traps<sup>24</sup> for human beings may be set out if it is suspected
that an attack is imminent. In certain localities I have seen a
stockade<sup>25</sup> erected around the house. Sometimes a wall of old
bamboo may be built from the ground up to the floor, inclined inward at
the bottom at an angle of about 70° to the ground. The ladder is
invariably a log with a number of notches in it. Strips of bark or even
bamboo shingles may form the roof but as a rule the Manóbo takes his
chances with a roof of rattan leaf.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup><i>I-li-hán</i>.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup><i>Bá-tik</i>.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup><i>In-á-gud</i>.</p>

<p>On approaching the house of one who is in state of vigilance, it is
not unusual to find certain signs on the trail. Thus a broken earthen
pot is frequently hung up, or if the trail leads to the house of a
warrior chief, there will be probably the parted bamboo called
<i>binúka</i>, and a number of saplings slashed down at a certain point
on the trail, both of which signs are symbolic of the evil fate that
will befall such as dare to enter the guarded region.</p>

<p>No one but a near relative may live within a certain definite
distance of a house which is in a state of defense, nor may anyone visit
it except by special request. If the inmate has to meet anyone he
appoints a trysting place at some spot in the woods and there the
visitor, by beating on the butress[sic] of a tree or by any other
preconcerted signal, announces his presence. The former may be
suspicious and may first circle around to examine the footprints before
he ventures to approach.</p>

<center>
<a name="3I8"></a>
<h4>PEACE<sup>26</sup></h4>
</center>

<p><sup>26</sup><i>Dug-kút</i>.</p>

<p>When the opposing parties have evened up their blood accounts and are
wearied of ambushes, surprises, loss of relatives, destruction of crops,
and continual fight and flight, they agree to make peace either through
a friendly chief, or by a formal peacemaking. The desire to make peace
is made known by sending to the enemy a work bolo. If it is accepted, it
is a sign that the desire is mutual but if it is returned, arbitration
must be brought about through a third party, usually a warrior chief or
a <i>datu</i>. For this purpose a clear open space, such as a big
sandbar, is appointed and a day fixed.</p>

<p>On the appointed day the parties arrive in separate bands and take up
their positions facing one another, a line being drawn or a long piece
of rattan being placed on the ground beyond which no member of either
party may pass. Matters are then discussed in the presence of such
<i>datus</i> or persons of influence as may have been selected for that
purpose and after balancing up blood and other debts, the leaders agree
to make the payments at an appointed time and thereby put an end to the
feud. As an evidence of their sincerity, they part between them a piece
of green rattan.<sup>27</sup> Then beeswax<sup>28</sup> is burned. This
is a kind of oath which serves to bind them to their
contracts.<sup>29</sup></p>

<p><sup>27</sup>I have been informed of a very interesting custom said
to be observed by the Banuáon group in settling their troubles. It was
said that peace is made by hand-to-hand fights in which single pairs of
opponents fight until the <i>datus</i> who act as umpires award the
victory to one or the other. This is called <i>din-a-tú-an</i>.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup><i>Tó-tuñg</i>.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup>I never witnessed a peacemaking and I never had a chance
to assist at one of the referred combats of the Banuáon people,
mentioned above.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>
<h3>POLITICAL ORGANIZATION: GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF
JUSTICE; CUSTOMARY, PROPRIETARY, AND LIABILITY LAWS</h3>

<a name="3J1"></a>
<h4>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
</center>

<p>Bisáyas and other people who have had more or less familiar dealings
with Manóbos almost invariably make the statement that Manóbo justice is
the oppression of the weak by the strong; that there is no customary law
that governs in social dealings except that one which is founded on the
caprice and villainy of the warrior chiefs and of those who have most
influence and following. Now I utterly repudiate such statements and
rumors as being due either to lack of familiarity; to a too ready
tendency to believe malicious reports; or to undisguised ill will
toward, and contempt of, Manóbos. I have lived on familiar terms with
these primitive people for a considerable period and have found no
evidence of oppression and tyranny. Disputes and misunderstandings arise
at times, people sometimes fly into a rage, killings take place on
occasions, but such things happen among other peoples. It is truly
surprising, considering the lack of tribal and interclan cohesion in
Manóboland, that such occurrences are not more frequent or even
continual. The statement that the warriors and other influential men
rule by caprice and oppression is unfounded. There is no coercion in
Manóboland, except such as arises from the influence of relatives, and
from gentle persuasion and general consent. A warrior chief, or any
other man who would try to use a despotic hand or even to be insolent,
exacting, or unrelenting in his manner, would not only lose his friends
and his influence, but would arouse hostility and place himself and his
relatives in jeopardy.</p>

<p>It must be understood from the outset that in Manóboland there is no
constituted judicial authority nor any definite system of laws. There
are no courts, and no punishments such as imprisonment, torturing, and
whipping. All social dealings by which one contracts an obligation to
another are regulated by the principle that one and all must act
according to established custom. This principle governs the procedure
even of chiefs and influential men when they endeavor to bring about a
settlement through the weight of their influence.</p>

<p>Voluntary and involuntary departures from the beaten track cause
disputes when these deviations affect another's rights. Thus to refuse
one the hospitality of the house, or to overlook him intentionally in
the distribution of betel nut would give rise to a dispute, because
these courtesies are customary and are therefore obligatory.</p>

<p>Punishment for a violation of customary obligation then becomes a
matter of private justice. The injured one either singly, or by means of
his relatives and of such friends as he may interest in his cause, seeks
reparation from the offender. If he can not secure it through an appeal
to customary law supported by the consensus of opinion of the relatives
on each side, he takes justice into his own hands and kills his opponent
or orders him to be killed.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J2"></a>
<h4>GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h4>

<a name="3J21"></a>
<h5>THE PRINCIPLE OF MATERIAL SUBSTITUTION</h5>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo system of law is still in its indefinite primitive stage.
Its fundamental principles are involved in the retention, preservation,
and devolution of property. Unlike the highly developed legal systems of
the world, it tends, in general, to consider violations as civil, and
not as criminal, wrongs. Hence upon due restitution, offered with good
will, the great majority of transgressions upon another's rights are
quickly condoned. In this it is far more humane than other systems that
seek not only justice for the injured party but the corporal punishment
of the wrongdoer.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J22"></a>
<h5>RIGHT TO A FAIR HEARING</h5>
</center>

<p>As far as my observation goes justice is administered on a
patriarchal plan in a spirit of fairness and equality. Except in the
case of flagrant public wrongs the transgressor is given a fair and
impartial hearing, aided by the presence of his relatives and of others
whom he may select or who may choose to attend the arbitration of the
case. The presence of the relatives contributes in nearly every case an
element of good will, and prevents the use of intimidation. It helps
greatly to promote, and not to prevent, justice. It is the paramount
factor in determining the defendant to yield, even when bad feeling has
been aroused on each side, and when their desire for revenge and spirit
of independence would naturally prompt them to have recourse to violent
methods. Though the female relatives do not take formal part in the
arbitration, yet in their own gentle way they exert a certain amount of
influence for good.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J23"></a>
<h5>SECURING THE DEFENDANT'S GOOD WILL</h5>
</center>

<p>Because of the desire for revenge which the Manóbo inherits and the
universal recognition of the revenge system in Manóboland, an appeal to
good will in the settlement of matters is very important, and is a
feature of every case of arbitration. I have attended many and many a
Manóbo arbitration at which the wrongdoer, after being condemned by the
consensus of opinion, was asked over and over whether he recognized his
fault and whether he received the sentence with good will. In nearly
every instance he replied that he did, and, as an evidence of his
sincerity, procured, as soon as convenient, a pig and invited the
assembly to a feast. On one occasion I acted as the judge in a case of
rape committed by a Manóbo who had had frequent dealings with Christian
Manóbos. At my urgent request his life was spared and a fine of 100
pesos was imposed upon him. After he had expressed his conformity with
the sentence and his lack of ill feeling toward his accusers, I notified
the chief of the other party of my intention to leave the settlement,
whereupon he told me secretly that I had better wait as the defendant in
the case would undoubtedly entertain the company with pork and
potations. And so it happened, for the defendant procured a pig that
must have been worth 15 pesos, and a supply of sugarcane wine that must
have cost him a few more, expenditures that would not be deducted from
the amount of his fine.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J24"></a>
<h5>FOUNDATIONS OF MANÓBO LAW</h5>
</center>

<p>Owing to the utter lack of interclan and tribal organization there is
no set of statute laws in Manóboland, but, in lieu of them, there are a
number of traditional laws, simple and definite, that, in conjunction
with religious interdictions, serve in the main to uphold justice, the
foundation of all law. There is no word for law in the whole Manóbo
dialect, but the word for custom<sup>1</sup> is used invariably to
express the regulations that govern dealings between man and man.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Ba-tá-san</i>.</p>

<p>One fundamental law is the obligation to pay a debt, whether it be a
blood debt or a material one. A very common axiom says that &#34;there
is no debt that will not be paid&#34;--if not to-day, to-morrow; if not
during one lifetime, during another--for the collection of it will be
bequeathed as a sacred inheritance from father to son, and from son to
grandson. Montano<sup>2</sup> notes with surprise the sacredness in
which debts are held, not only by Manóbos of the Agúsan Valley but by
all the numerous tribes with which he came in contact in his travels
around the gulf of Davao. I noted the same throughout eastern Mindanáo.
The Manóbo, when called to account, will never deny his true
indebtedness, and when no further time is given him, he will satisfy his
obligations, even if he has to part with his personal effects at a
nominal value or put himself deeply in debt to others. He is never
considered insolvent. It is true that the Christianized part of
Manóboland is not so punctilious in the settlement of financial
obligations to outsiders (Bisáyas), but this is explained by the bad
feeling that has arisen toward the latter on account of-the wholesale,
fraudulent exploitation carried on in commercial dealings between them
and the Christian Manóbos.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Une mission aux Isles Philippines.</p>

<p>So many references have already been made in previous chapters to the
practice of revenge that it is not necessary to dilate upon it here.
Suffice it to say that it is not only the right but the duty, often
bequeathed by father to son, to obey this stern law. One who would allow
a deliberate breach of his rights to pass without obtaining sufficient
compensation would be looked down upon as a sorry specimen of manhood.
The feeling is so deeply rooted in the heart that the wife may urge her
husband, and the fiancé, her lover, to carry out the law, and the father
may instill into the hearts of his little ones the desire to wreak
vengeance upon their common enemies.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J3"></a>
<h4>CUSTOMARY LAW</h4>

<a name="3J31"></a>
<h5>ITS NATURAL BASIS</h5>
</center>

<p>The intense conservatism of the Manóbo, fostered by the priestly
order, is the basis of the customary law that determines and regulates
social and individual dealings in Manóboland. So strong is this
conservatism, based on a religious principle, that it is believed that
any act not consistent with established customs arouses the resentment
of the spirit world. This feeling exerts so powerful an influence that
in many cases a definite custom is carried out even when a departure
from it would be manifestly to the material advantage of the individual.
As has been set forth before in this monograph, the ridiculously low
prices at which rice is sold in harvest time is a case in point.</p>

<p>The extreme cautiousness and suspiciousness that is such a dominant
feature of Manóbo character tends also to maintain the customary law.
The Manóbo prefers to jog along in the same old way rather than to do
anything unusual, thereby laying himself open to the displeasure of his
fellowmen and to that of the gods.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J32"></a>
<h5>ITS RELIGIOUS BASIS</h5>
</center>

<p>The legion of taboos, religious and magic, limits the Manóbo's
actions, in no inconsiderable manner, within fixed and definite rules,
the nonobservance of which would render him responsible for such evil
consequences as might follow. To cite an instance: When I first went
into a region near Talakógon that was considered to belong to a local
deity, my guide cautioned me to avoid certain actions which, he said,
were displeasing to the reigning deity. I asked him what would be the
consequence if harm were to befall him as a result of my failure to
comply with his instructions. He quietly informed me that I would be
responsible to his relatives for any harm which might come to him.</p>

<p>Again if one enters a rice field during harvest time the displeasure
of the goddess of grain is aroused, and the rice is likely to be
diminished in quantity. The transgressor may do all in his power to
appease the offended goddess, but if she refuses to be appeased and
permits a decrease of the supply, not otherwise explainable, he will be
held responsible, and in the due course of events will have to make good
the shortage according to the tenets of customary law.</p>

<p>Another example will show the rigid regulations that custom imposes
in the matter of omens. I started out with a Manóbo of the upper Agúsan
for a point up the Nábok River. At the beginning of our trip the turtle
bird's cry came from a direction directly in front of us--an indication
of impending evil either during the trip or at its termination. My guide
and companion begged me not to proceed, but I managed to convince him
that there was nothing to be feared, so he consented to continue the
trip with me. Now it happened that he had a quantity of loose beads in
his betel-nut knapsack and that a hole was worn in the sack before the
end of the trip, the result being that he lost his beads. He held a
consultation with the chief of the settlement at which we had arrived,
explaining the omen bird's evil cry and the efforts he had made to
persuade me to desist from the trip. It was decided that because of my
failure to follow the directions indicated by the omen bird, I was
responsible for the loss of the beads. On further discussion of the
point it became apparent that I would have had to answer for the life of
my companion, if he had lost it on the trail, for it was intimated to me
that the omen bird's voice had clearly warned us of danger and I was
requested to explain my failure to heed the warning.</p>

<p>The observance of customs for religious reasons suggests an
explanation of many acts that to an outsider seem inexplicable, not to
say unreasonable. The selection of farm sites at considerable distances
from the dwelling, the reluctance to leave the region of one's birth,
the unwillingness to visit remote mountains and similar places, the fear
of doing anything unusual in places thought to be the domain of a
deity--these and numerous other ideas--are to be attributed to the
observance of customary law.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be well to remark that a stranger visiting
remote Manóbo settlements without an introduction or without previous
warning should be very careful, if he desires to deal with these
primitive people in a spirit of friendship, not to break openly and
flagrantly any such regulations, principally religious ones, as may be
pointed out to him. In fact it would be well to ascertain as soon as
possible what is expected of him. I have always made it a point to
announce that I would not be responsible for any evil consequences
attending my violation of customs that I was ignorant of and I have
requested my new friends to acquaint me with such customs and beliefs as
might differ from those of other Manóbo settlements.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J4"></a>
<h4>PROPRIETARY LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS</h4>

<a name="3J41"></a>
<h5>CONCEPTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS</h5>
</center>

<p>Property rights in the full sense of the word are not only very
clearly understood but very sternly maintained. The Manóbo conception of
them is so high that, with the exception of such things as
<i>camotes</i> and other vegetable products, even gifts must be paid
for. And even for such trifling things as <i>camotes</i>, an equivalent
in kind is expected at the option of the donor. During my wanderings I
was always in the habit of making presents as compensation for the food
furnished me, and was frequently asked why I had done so, and why I did
not make the recipients of these presents pay me. No explanation could
change the strong belief that all property of any value, whether given
under contract or not, should be paid for. This principle is further
evidenced by the fact that there is no word in the Manóbo dialect for
gift nor is there any word for thanks. In some places, however, they
have a conception of &#34;alms.&#34;<sup>3</sup> On many occasions one
of the first requests made to me by a new acquaintance of some standing
was a request for alms. I am of opinion that this idea was acquired by
them from the universal reports concerning the liberality of the
missionaries who from the middle of the seventeenth century labored in
the Agúsan Valley. A request for alms or for a present of any value is
seldom made by one Manóbo of another, but when it is made it is met by a
simple answer, &#34;I do not owe you anything.&#34; That settles the
question at once.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Lí-mos</i>, probably from the Spanish <i>limosna</i>,
alms.</p>

<p>My practice of distributing gifts frequently aroused some ill
feeling. For example, on many occasions I was asked by individuals why I
had made presents to so-and-so and not to them. It was necessary in
these cases to explain that I owed a debt of good will to the
individuals referred to and that I would most assuredly give like gifts
to others whenever I should become indebted to them in a similar
manner.</p>

<h5>LAND AND OTHER PROPERTY</h5>
</center>

<p>Customary law regarding public land is very simple. Each clan and, in
some cases, one or more individual family chiefs, have districts which
are the collective property of the clan or family. Theoretically this
ownership gives hunting, fishing, agricultural, and other rights to that
clan or family, to the exclusion of others. In practice, however, anyone
who is on good terms with the chief who represents the family or the
clan in question, may occupy a portion of the land without any other
formality than that of mentioning the matter to the proper chief. The
occupation presumes that the occupant is on terms of good will with the
chief, and it never implies that the new occupant is required to pay
anything for the use of the land. With regard to fishing rights,
especially when the fish-poisoning method is employed, it is very often
stipulated that a share of the catch shall be given to the owner. When
the two parties concerned are on good terms, the territory of one may be
used by the other for hunting, apparently without any question.</p>

<p>When the rice-sowing season is at hand, the Manóbo goes over the clan
district and selects any piece of vacant land that, because of its
fertility and closeness to water, may have recommended itself to him
after a due consultation of the omens. Having made the selection, he
formally takes possession of the land by slashing down a few small trees
in a conspicuous place and by parting the top of a small tree stem and
inserting into it at right angles a piece of wood. He then returns to
his settlement and announces his selection. He has become now the owner
of the land. Anyone who might attempt to claim the land would become
cleft, so it is believed, like the parted stem that was left as a proof
of the occupation of the land. In a few cases I saw a broken earthen pot
left on an upright stick. It was explained to me that this, too, was a
symbol of what would befall the one who would dare to dispute the right
to the property. This is another evidence of the widespread belief in
sympathetic magic.</p>

<p>In my travels throughout eastern Mindanáo I never heard of a single
instance of a land dispute among the non-Christian peoples. There is no
reason for dispute because the whole of the interior is an immense and
very sparsely populated forest that could support millions instead of
the scant population which is now scattered through it. Moreover, the
religious element in the selection, the consultation of omens, and the
approval by the unseen world seem to prevent disputes.</p>

<p>From the moment of occupation, then, till the abandonment of the site
the occupant is the sole lawful owner of the land and has full rights to
proprietorship of all that it produces. When he abandons the land he
still retains the ownership of such crops or plants as may be growing on
it. Hence betel-nut palms, betel plants, bananas, and other plants,
belong, to him and to his descendants after him. Even such fugitive
crops as <i>camotes</i> are his until they die off or are destroyed by
wild boars.</p>

<p>Fruit trees, such as durian, jack-fruit, and others growing in the
forest, are, in theory, the collective property of a clan or of a
family, but in practice anyone may help himself. However, the finder
becomes sole and exclusive owner of a bee's nest as soon as he sets up
an indication of his ownership in the form of a split stick with a small
crosspiece, and announces his possessive rights on his return to the
settlement. The parted trunk has a form and significance similar to that
which it has in connection with the selection of a new site. As far as I
know a bee's nest once located by one individual is seldom appropriated
by another, but the theft of palm wine is common enough, especially if
the palm tree be at a considerable distance from the owner's
settlement.</p>

<p>All other property that is the result of one's own labor, or that has
been acquired by purchase or in any other customary way, belongs to the
individual, unless he is a slave. Even slaves, captured during war
raids, become the property of their captors, unless stipulation to the
contrary has been made before the raid. In one expedition that took
place in 1907 a certain warrior chief was delegated to punish a
Mañgguáñgan. As an advance payment he received a few bolos and lances,
but it was expressly agreed that after the attack he and his party were
to receive all the slaves captured.</p>

<p>With regard to the loss of, or damage to, property belonging to
another, the customary law is rigid; the damage or the loss must be made
good, no matter how unfortunate may have been the circumstances of the
loss. This will explain the great care that carriers exercise in
transporting the property of others through the mountains, for if by any
mischance the things were to get lost or wet or broken, or damaged in
any other way, they would be required to make good the loss. This
custom, as applied in some cases, may seem somewhat harsh, but it must
be remembered that Manóboland is a land where the law of vengeance
prevails, and that no opportunity to wreak vengeance must be given. Such
opportunities would occur if anyone were permitted to attribute a loss
or other accident to involuntary causes.</p>

<p>This rigid law will explain also the peculiar liability under which
one is sometimes placed for an absolutely unintentional and unforeseen
act. Thus, on a certain occasion, one of my carriers died a few days
after my arrival in a settlement. Shortly after the occurrence of the
death I was confronted by a band of the relatives of the deceased in
full panoply and requested to pay the commercial equivalent of a
slave.</p>

<p>On another occasion I ran after a child in play. The child out of
fright rushed into the forest and hid. The same afternoon it was taken
with a violent fever to which it succumbed a few days later. I was not
in the settlement at the time of the death, and was not sorry, for it
was reported to me that the father of the deceased child had said that
he would have killed me. On my return to his settlement a few days later
I visited the father for the purpose of having the case arbitrated. He
broached the subject and demanded three slaves, or their equivalent, in
payment for the death of his child, which was due, he firmly believed
and asseverated, to the scare that I had given it.</p>

<p>Many instances might be adduced to illustrate the peculiar liability
which one undergoes in dealing with these primitive men who follow out
in practice the old fallacy of <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J5"></a>
<h4>LAWS OF CONTRACT</h4>
</center>

<p>The conception of contract is as universal as the conception of
property rights, but a certain amount of leniency seems to be expected
in such details as fulfilling the terms of the contract on the specified
date, unless it has been expressly and formally agreed that no leniency
is to be looked for. In case of a failure to fulfill the contract at the
stated time it is customary to offer either what is called an
&#34;excuse,&#34;<sup>4</sup> in the form of extra hospitality or a free
gift of some article, not so valuable as to constitute a debt, or to
make many explanations, very frequently fictitious. These remarks apply
only to cases in which the creditor has undergone the hardship of a
reasonably long trip or of other necessary expenditures. Thus, to
illustrate the point, A owes B a pig deliverable, according to
agreement, after the lapse of so many days, there being no express
provisions for any penalty in case of nonfulfillment of the agreement. B
goes to A's house and is treated to a special meal with an accompaniment
of drink when obtainable. Toward the termination of the meal, he is
informed by A of the latter's inability to pay, for numerous real, or
more numerous fictitious, reasons. B accepts this excuse but before
leaving asks for some little thing that he may take a fancy to. It is
always given as an &#34;excuse.&#34; Another day for the payment is
agreed upon. This leniency may be displayed on one or more occasions
till the delay in paying exasperates B or renders him liable to loss.
Ill feeling arises all the more readily if B feels that A has not been
as assiduous as he should have been. Then a stringent contract is
entered upon, the nonperformance of which will render A liable to
interest or to a fine, as may be stipulated.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>Ba-lí-bad</i>.</p>

<p>In cases where serious consequences might result from a failure to
fulfill a contract, it is customary for the contractor and often for the
other party to make a number of knots on a strip of rattan, each knot
signifying a day of the time to elapse before payment, or representing
one article of the goods to be paid for, or one item of the goods to be
delivered.</p>

<p>All more important contracts are made in the presence of witnesses,
and the time and the number of articles to be delivered are counted out
on the floor with grains of corn or with little pieces of wood, or are
indicated by counting a corresponding number of the slats of the
floor.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J6"></a>
<h4>THE LAW OF DEBT</h4>
</center>

<p>The law of debt in Manóboland is so rigid that failure to comply with
it has given rise to many a bloody feud. All commercial transactions are
conducted on a credit basis. An individual whom we will call A needs a
pig, for instance, and starts out on a quest to secure one. He visits
one of his acquaintances and informally brings up the subject,
remarking, for example, that he would like to buy a certain pig that is
in the settlement. He may not be able to make the purchase until he has
tried several settlements, for it may happen that the owner of each pig
may want in exchange objects that A does not have and is unable to get.
Thus B, the owner of a pig in the first settlement, wants in payment a
Mandáya lance of a certain length, breadth, and make. Now A knows of no
one from whom he can procure such a lance, so he has to go on to the
settlement of C who in exchange for his pig wants five pieces of Mandáya
cloth. A is afraid to take the pig on such terms because the Ihawán
Manóbos are in arms on account of a recent killing, and as the trade
route for Mandáya cloth passes through the territory of the Ihawán
Manóbos he sees no possibility of fulfilling a contract to deliver the
cloth. So off he goes to the settlement of D where he finds a pig for
which the owner demands four yards of blue cloth, two of red, and two of
black, together with a specified quantity of salt. A thinks that it will
be easy for him to run over to some Christian settlement and get those
articles in time to pay D, so he clinches the bargain by putting a
series of knots in a strip of rattan to represent the number of days to
expire before the date of payment. This he delivers to D and the
contract is sealed. He then returns to his settlement with his pig, and
turns it over to some one else perhaps, to whom he owes a pig, or, if it
was intended for a sacrifice, to the family priest or priestess. In due
time it is disposed of with much satisfaction to the gods and to the
inner man. As the day for payment approaches, A must take measures to
get the salt and the cloth for D, so he hastens to the settlement of E,
if sickness in the family, or heavy rains, or some other obstacle does
not prevent him, but finds that E requires a Mandáya bolo for the
articles needed and as A has no such object and sees no immediate
prospect of obtaining it, he goes on to F's. F demands a certain amount
of beeswax and a Mandáya dagger in exchange for the cloth and the salt
and as A feels that he can procure these articles, he closes the
bargain, promising to deliver the goods within so many days or weeks.</p>

<p>A now owes D cloth and salt, payable within 14 days, let us suppose.
He is also under contract to F to furnish him a dagger and a specified
amount of beeswax, also on a specified date. Upon the approach of the
time agreed upon A runs over to F's only to find that F had been unable
to get the cloth and the salt, either because no Bisáya trader has been
up to the Christianized settlement on the river; or because of heavy
rains or for some other reason. The result is that A returns to his
settlement without the cloth and the salt. Upon his arrival at D's or
upon D's arrival at his settlement, as the case may be, he excuses
himself to D, setting forth in detail the reason for his failure. He
treats D as best he can, and fixes another date for the delivery of the
salt and the cloth, the same to be delivered at D's settlement. D
returns to his home without the salt and the cloth and awaits the
delivery.</p>

<p>Now it may happen that, through the fault of A or through the fault
of F or through unforeseen circumstances, A is unable to keep his
agreement. D has made many useless trips to collect from A. It is true
that D has been feasted by A upon every visit but the long delay, and
possibly his debt of salt to someone else, is gradually provoking him.
So one day he speaks somewhat strongly to A, setting a definite term for
the payment. If A is unable to meet his obligations after this
ultimatum, or if D suspects or has proof that A is playing a game,
matters become strained and D has recourse to one of three methods: (1)
Collection by armed intimidation; (2) the <i>tawágan</i> or seizure; (3)
war raid.</p>

<p>The last two methods have been sufficiently explained in Chapter
XVIII but the first needs a little explanation.</p>

<p>After all attempts to collect by peaceable means have failed, the
creditor assembles his male relatives and friends and proceeds to the
house of the debtor with all the accoutrements of war. It is customary
to bring along a neutral chief or two from other clans. Upon arriving at
the debtor's house no hostile demonstrations are made. The creditor and
his party enter as if their object were an ordinary visit. Should,
however, the debtor have abandoned his house, this part of the affair
would be at an end, for the creditor would be justified in adopting the
second method (i. e., the seizing of any object, human of other that he
might see), or the third method.</p>

<p>Should his debtor, however, be present, the creditor and his
companions are regaled with betel nut and food and the meeting is
perfectly goodnatured. But gradually the subject of the debt is
introduced and then begins the pandemonium. If the chiefs who have
accompanied the creditor's party have enough moral influence to bring
about an agreement, the matter is settled, but if not, the visiting
party may depart suddenly with yells of menace and defiance, and very
frequently may have recourse to the seizure method, taking on their way
home any object that they may encounter such as a pig, or even a human
being. Hence as soon as it becomes known that no settlement has been
made bamboo joints<sup>5</sup> are blown--the invariable signal in
Manóboland of danger--and everybody goes into armed vigilance. Children
and women are not allowed to leave the house, and pigs are frequently
taken from below and put up in the house until the enraged creditor and
his party have gone.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup><i>Tam-bú-li</i>.</p>

<p>I was in one place where such a state of things existed. My
merchandise was taken by my host from under the house and carefully
hidden upstairs. I wished to go to meet the collecting party but no one
would volunteer to accompany me.</p>

<p>If an agreement to pay has been brought about, the debtor has to make
the settlement before the departure of his creditor, even though it may
require several days to complete the payment. In this latter case the
sustenance of the visiting party and all their needs fall, by custom,
upon the poor debtor.</p>

<p>Such is the customary method of collecting debts when all peaceable
efforts have been unavailing. To understand the principle involved in
it, as also the circumstances that bring it about, it is necessary to
bear in mind that once the creditor becomes disgusted with the delay of
his debtor in settling the account, he announces his intention to add to
the indebtedness a financial equivalent of all fatigues<sup>6</sup> and
expenses to be subsequently incurred in the collection of the debt.
These fatigues not only include the actual trips made both by himself
and such messengers as he may send to collect the debt, but such
incidental losses, sicknesses, or accidents as may be the outcome of
such trips.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup><i>Ka-há-go</i>.</p>

<p>Another principle recognized in this matter is the liability into
which the debtor may fall for such losses as the creditor may undergo
through his failure to fulfill his obligations to a third person. Thus A
owes B a pig, and B owes C, who in his turn must pay a lance to D at a
certain time. On account of C's failure to deliver the lance in due time
to D, he is, according to a previous contract, mulcted to the equivalent
of 15 pesos. Had C been able to purchase a lance with the pig that B
owed him he would, by customary law, be justified in putting the fine of
15 pesos to B's account. B attributes his failure to A's delay and on
the same grounds, adds 15 pesos to the latter's indebtedness.</p>

<p>It is clear that the principle of liability involved in this system
gives rise to an infinity of disputes that may lead to bloodshed
whenever the matter can not be arbitrated by the more influential men
and chiefs in a public assembly. The debt after a certain time increases
beyond reasonable proportions until it finally becomes so great as to be
beyond the debtor's means. Notwithstanding the sacredness with which the
average Manóbo regards his debts, it happens occasionally that a little
bad feeling springs up which, in the course of time may lead to serious
consequences. It will be readily understood how easy it is for one party
to take umbrage at the words or actions of another and to become
obstinate. Happily, however, this does not happen frequently, on account
of the salutary fear inspired by the lance and the bolo, and the urgent
endeavors of the chiefs and the more influential men to settle matters
amicably. I am surprised that disputes and bloodshed arising from, the
great credit system do not occur more frequently among such primitive
people.</p>

<p>Though in practice the relatives of a debtor assist him to settle his
obligations, especially when he is hard pressed by his creditor, yet in
theory there is no joint obligation to pay the debt. Neither do they, as
a rule, assume a collective responsibility for it.</p>

<p>Between relatives, as between others, the law regarding the payment
of a debt is strenuously maintained, though I know of no case between
near relatives in which it led to more than family bickerings. A very
careful account of the indebtedness of one relative to another is
sedulously kept.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J7"></a>
<h4>INTEREST, LOANS, AND PLEDGES</h4>

<a name="3J71"></a>
<h5>INTEREST</h5>
</center>

<p>No interest is charged unless an express contract is made to that
effect. In the case of a loan of paddy, however, even if no formal
contract has been made, twice as much must be returned as was borrowed.
Express contracts that call for interest are rather rare, as far as my
observation goes, and when such contracts are made they are usually of a
usurious nature, due, as I have noticed on several occasions, not so
much to the desire for material gain, as to that of satisfying an old
grudge against the borrower. In settlements that have had experience
with the usurious methods of Christian natives, one finds here and there
an individual who tries to follow the example set him by people that he
looks up to. This practice is universally discountenanced, and, though
it is submitted to under necessity in commercial dealings with Bisáyas,
it gives rise to no inconsiderable ill feeling, a fact that explains, to
my mind, the difficulties that Bisáyas experience in collecting from
Christianized Manóbos, as also the killing of many a Bisáya in
pre-American days. During my trading tour of 1908 there was universal
complaint made to me by Manóbos of the upper Agúsan, upper Umaíam, and
upper Argáwan Rivers against the system of usury employed by Bisáya
traders, and many a time I heard this remark made concerning certain
individuals: &#34;We would kill him if we were not afraid of the
Americans.&#34;</p>

<center>
<a name="3J72"></a>
<h5>LOANS AND PLEDGES</h5>
</center>

<p>With the exception of articles borrowed on condition that they are to
be returned, loans are very rare in Manóboland. The most usual loan is
that of paddy. Articles borrowed must be returned in as good a condition
as that in which they were received.</p>

<p>I know of no leases among non-Christian Manóbos. Land is too
plentiful to lease; other property is either sold or borrowed.</p>

<p>I have never known a material pledge to be given, but the custom of
going bond seems to be very generally understood though not much
practiced, as such a custom insinuates a distrust that does not seem to
be pleasing to the Manóbo. A notable feature of the practice is the
principle that the <i>bondsman becomes the payer</i>. I am inclined to
think that this principle was taught to their mountain compeers by
Bisáya and Christianized Manóbos who found in it a convenient expedient
whereby to make the collection of debts easier and sure. On the strength
of it, a chief or a more well-to-do member of the tribe becomes
responsible for the debt of one whose surety he became.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J8"></a>
<h4>LAWS OF LIABILITY</h4>

<a name="3J81"></a>
<h5>LIABILITY ARISING FROM NATURAL CAUSES</h5>
</center>

<p>The liability here referred to is the general responsibility that a
person acquires for consequences that are imputed to an act of his,
whether voluntary or involuntary. Instances of this strange law arise on
many occasions in Manóboland. The reader is referred to the case of the
loss of the beads, the attempt to collect from me for the natural death
of one of my carriers, for the death of a child that I had frightened,
and other instances mentioned previously, all of which show the idea of
responsibility for consequences following an act. A few more instances
will make the principle involved clearer. On the upper Agúsan, a Manóbo
of Nábuk River went over to Moncáyo to collect a debt. According to
custom he carried his shield and spear. Now it happened that there were
two women walking along the river bank, one of whom was the wife of an
enemy of this Nábuk warrior. Upon seeing him she became frightened, fell
into the river, and was drowned. The result of this was that the Nábuk
man was condemned to pay a slave or its equivalent. As a near relative
of his enemy owed him &#34;thirty&#34; (P30) he transferred the fine to
him but the transference was not accepted on the ground that the Nábuk
man ought to pay his fine first. A few days' discussion of the matter
resulted in the departure of the Nábuk man, who upon his arrival in a
near settlement killed, in his rage, one of his slaves. The outcome of
the whole affair was a feud between Moncáyo and Nábuk.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J82"></a>
<h5>LIABILITY ARISING FROM RELIGIOUS CAUSES</h5>
</center>

<p>The violation of the numerous taboos is believed to bring about evil
consequences that are chargeable to the account of the infringer. For
example, a man in Búai was charged 30 pesos for the breaking of a
certain birth taboo, a violation which was supposed to have been
responsible for the stillbirth of a child. I was warned on many
occasions to desist from making disrespectful remarks about animals,
such as monkeys or frogs, because, if Anítan were to hurl her
thunderbolts at one of my companions and harm were to befall him I would
be fined or killed. I would undergo a similar punishment, I was told on
other occasions, for using such tabooed words as crocodile and salt; it
was believed that a storm would be the result of the use of these words.
On one occasion I thought it prudent to give a carrier of mine a piece
of rubber cloth wherewith to cover his salt, for he had threatened to
collect from me if it became wet from the storm that was impending, and
which all my companions imputed to my deliberate use of the names of
certain fish not native to their mountain water.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J83"></a>
<h5>LIABILITY ARISING FROM MAGIC CAUSES</h5>
</center>

<p>Another pregnant source of fines and of sanguinary feuds is the
belief in the possession, by certain individuals, of magic power to do
harm. No one that I know of or have heard of, except a few fearless
warrior chiefs, has made open avowal of the possession of such power and
yet on many occasions I have heard of the supposed possession of it by
various individuals. To give an instance, a Manóbo on the upper Agúsan
had the reputation of having secret poisons. One day another Manóbo and
his wife visited him. With the exception of a trifling altercation about
a debt, everything went well. On her return home the woman was suddenly
taken sick and died. Her death was ascribed to the magic power of the
person recently visited and the outcome was that the party with the bad
reputation had to build a tree house, one of the few that I have seen,
and surround his settlement with an abatis of brush and of sharp spikes,
all in anticipation of an attack by the deceased woman's husband.</p>

<p>It was the rule rather than the exception that I, myself, had the
same reputation applied to me. Upon arrival in heretofore unvisited
regions I was fequently[sic] informed that they had heard of my
wonderful power of killing. On many occasions it was only by assuming a
bold front and by vowing vengeance on my traducers that I freed myself
from the imputation. In such cases I always asked for the name of the
slanderer, and, upon learning it, announced my intention of seeking him
without delay, for the purpose of clearing myself from the imputation
and of demanding satisfaction from him.</p>

<center>
<a name="3J84"></a>
<h5>THE SYSTEM OF FINES</h5>
</center>

<p>It is not intended here to consider the system of fines as penalties
for voluntary wrongdoings but only as punishments for certain little
acts of forgetfulness or of omission that might be construed as
conscious acts of disrespect. The system is a very strange one and, to
our way of thinking, very harsh, productive sometimes of bad feeling and
even of more serious results.</p>

<p>Instances that have passed under my personal observation will
illustrate the system. Thus, on one occasion an acquaintance of mine
left the house without making his intention known to those present.
While he was under the house, one of the guests happened to spit through
the floor upon the clothes of the man underneath. Upon his return he
identified the guilty one both by his position in the house, and by the
quality of the chewing material he was using. The case was discussed at
length and it was decided that for carelessness the guilty one should
make material reparation in the form of a chicken and some drink.</p>

<p>Again, the dog of a certain individual on the upper Agúsan was guilty
of soiling the clothes of a person that happened to be working under the
house. As the owner of the sick dog (it had been mangled by a wild boar)
had been previously warned of the possibility of something untoward
happening, he was fined and was condemned to make further reparation in
the form of a convivial meeting in order to remove the ill feeling.</p>

<p>Instances of fines that were imposed on me will illustrate the
principle involved. Upon my arrival in new regions I was almost
invariably called upon to pay a certain amount, on the ground that I had
had no permission to enter the settlement, or that the local deities had
been displeased at my visit, or that I was a spy, or for some other
reason. The refusal to pay was always accepted after lengthy
explanations and after the distribution of a few trifling gifts to the
more vehement members of the settlement, but in one case arms were drawn
and I had to take my stand with, back to the wall and await
developments.</p>

<p>Other instances in which unintentional disrespect toward the person
or property of anyone was displayed might be adduced to profusion. It
will suffice to say, however, that such acts as the following, even when
unintentional, lay the agent under a liability, the commercial value of
which must be determined by the circumstances and very frequently by
formal arbitration: Spitting upon, or otherwise soiling another; rudely
seizing the person of another; unbecoming treatment of another's
property, especially of his clothes, as when, for instance, one steps
upon another's shirt; opening another's betel-nut knapsack or other
concealed property; borrowing things without formal announcement and due
permission; going into certain places interdicted by the owner, as
bathing, for instance, in that part of a river which the owner has
forbidden the use of,<sup>7</sup> or visiting his rice granary; and
using disrespectful language, even in joke, about another, as, for
instance, speaking of one as an insect, a Mañgguáñgan.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Due, presumably, to the fact that the place, usually a
deep pool, is the abode of a water wraith.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>This is a term of reproach when applied to a Manóbo.</p>

<p>These interdictions are necessary among the Manóbos in order that in
their social dealings with one another proper deference may be shown
toward their person and property. For were a mere &#34;pardon me&#34; a
sufficient reparation for an act, however unintentional, advantage might
be taken of it to inflict a thousand and one little incivilities that
would serve to arouse the relentless spirit of revenge that centuries of
feuds have instilled into the Manóbo character.</p>

</center>

<p>The property of a Manóbo family is so scanty that the rules governing
it have never developed beyond a primitive stage. The house belongs
collectively to the father and to such of his sons-in-law and
brothers-in-law as may have constructed it. The structure represents
little value to the owner except that of the rough-hewn boards which may
be transported to another place. The reason that such cheap houses are
built is that they may be abandoned without much loss at any moment that
a death, or even a suspicion of danger, arising from religious or from
natural reasons, may dictate.</p>

<p>The movable property in the house belongs to the individuals who have
made, purchased, or in any other lawful way acquired it. In this respect
it is to be noted that each married couple provides itself with
household utensils and such other things as may be necessary. These
things do not become the property of the head of the family, but remain
the individual property of the person who brings them.</p>

<p>It must be noted, too, that women, children, and slaves have
theoretically no right to ownership. It is true that women are allowed
to dispose of the products of their labor like rice and cloth, but
usually, if not always, the consent of their husbands or of their
husbands' nearest male relatives is first secured if the article is of
much value. Frequently a consultation is held with the head of the whole
household.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K2"></a>
<h4>RULES OF INHERITANCE</h4>
</center>

<p>When a man dies and leaves no near relatives that are of sufficient
age to manage the inheritance, the elder brother-in-law inherits the
property. The deceased brother's wife is a part of this property. When
the father dies, the son is the heir, and, if of sufficient age and
capabilities, takes the place of his father. But should he be deemed
incompetent by his near male relatives, his paternal uncle, or, if he
has none, a brother-in-law, becomes the manager of the household. Any
property which may be of value is thus retained within the line of male
descent. This is in accordance with the principles of the patriarchate
system which prevails in Manóboland.</p>

<p>The eldest son inherits his father's debts, but the administrator (if
in such unpretentious matters we may use so pretentious a word) pays the
debts collecting in turn from the son unless he be a near kinsman of the
deceased father. About matters of inheritance I have never even heard of
a dispute. The valuable property may consist of only a lance and a bolo,
or a dagger, and a few jars. The best suit of clothes together with
personal adornments, such as necklaces, are carried with the deceased to
his last resting place so that there is little left to quarrel over.
With the exception of the few heirlooms, if there be any, consisting of
a jar and some few other things, the greatest fear is entertained of
articles that belonged to the departed one. This fear is due to the
peculiar belief in the subtle, wayward feeling of the departed toward
the living.</p>

<h4>RULES GOVERNING THE RELATIONS OF THE SEXES</h4>

<a name="3K31"></a>
<h5>MORAL OFFENSES</h5>
</center>

<p>In the chapter on marriage the general principles governing the
relations of the sexes is set forth. The relations both antenuptial and
postnuptial are of the most stringent character.</p>

<p>As a Manóbo once told me, sexual morality is bound up with religion
and the greater violations of it are sometimes punished by the
divinities.</p>

<p>Such lighter offenses, as gazing at the person of a woman while she
is bathing, or on any other occasion when her person is exposed, are
punished with appropriate fines. Improper suggestions and unseemly jokes
undergo the same fate. It is a very common report among Bisáyas that to
touch a Manóbo woman's heel is an exceptionally serious offense against
Manóbo law. I never heard of any such regulation among Manóbos, although
it may exist. To touch any other part of her person, however, is an
offense punishable by a good-sized fine.</p>

<p>Death is the consequence of adultery, fornication, and seduction,
except in very exceptional cases where the influence of the guilty one's
relatives may save him. But it is certain that in these cases the fine
is very heavy. I believe that it is never less than the equivalent of
three slaves.</p>

<p>All reports, both Bisáya and Manóbo, state that when fornication has
been attempted or accomplished the woman herself may make known the
offense to her parents and relatives.</p>

<p>The law is even more rigid in the matter of adultery. While I was on
the upper Agúsan River a case of adultery committed by a Christianized
man and woman was discovered. The death of the man had been decided
upon, and that of the woman was being mooted. I succeeded in having the
death sentence commuted to a heavy fine of three slaves.</p>

<p>It is the common report in Manóboland that, when a woman makes known
the act of her lover, the latter does not deny it. Not only under such
circumstances, but in nearly all other instances when brought face to
face with the truth a Manóbo will confess, sometimes even though there
be no witness against him. Such is my observation of dealings between
Manóbo and Manóbo. In his relations with outsiders, however, the Manóbo
is not so veracious; on the contrary, he displays no little art in
suppressing or in twisting the truth.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K32"></a>
<h5>MARRIAGE CONTRACTS AND PAYMENTS</h5>
</center>

<p>In the chapter on marital relations it was made manifest that
marriage is practically a sale in which a certain amount of the marriage
price is returned to the bridegroom. This rule is very stringent. Should
the marriage negotiations discontinue without any fault of the man or of
his relatives all payments previously made have to be returned, item for
item. In this respect it is to be noted that marriage contracts are
almost relentlessly rigid, a fact that suggests an explanation of the
length of the period that is usually required to terminate the
negotiations. For it is only by many acts of attention and even of
subservience that the suitor's relatives break down the obdurateness of
the fiancé's relatives and make them relax the severity of their
original demands. Very minute and strict accounts of the various
payments, including such small donations as a few liters of rice, are
recorded on a knotted rattan strip in anticipation of a final
disagreement.</p>

<p>When it is decided that the marriage is not to take place by reason
of the death of one of the affianced parties, the father and relatives
of the fiancé must return all the purchase payments which may have been
made. Custom provides that these payments shall be returned gradually,
the idea being, presumably, to allow the fiancé's relatives an
opportunity to profit by the donations of a new suitor, if one should
present himself within a stipulated period. It will be readily
understood that the nature of the debts incurred by an obligation to
return marriage payments determines the character of the payments that
will be exacted from a new suitor. Thus, if A's relatives, for good
reasons, decide not to continue their suit for the hand of B's daughter,
B would be granted a specified time in which to await the presentation
of a new suitor for his daughter's hand. This new suitor would be
required to bring a lance, for example, and other objects that would
serve as first and more urgent payments to A.</p>

<p>In the case of fornication committed by a man with his fiancé, death
may be the penalty if the girl's father desires to have the marriage
broken off, but I was given to understand that such a heavy penalty is
rarely inflicted, the girl's father contenting himself with imposing a
heavy fine.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K33"></a>
<h5>ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN</h5>
</center>

<p>In all my wandering among the Manóbos, I never knew nor heard of an
illegitimate child, so can not say what regulations govern, if such
births occur. In Mandáyaland the father of an illegitimate child is
obliged to marry the girl and to enter his father-in-law's family in a
state of semiservitude. The marriage takes place before the birth of the
child.</p>

<p>I was told by Mandáyas that illegitimate children belong to the
nearest male relative of the mother, that in case of her marriage they
still belong to her relative, and that they are treated in all other
respects as legitimate children.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K34"></a>
<h5>EXTENT OF AUTHORITY OF FATHER AND HUSBAND</h5>
</center>

<p>The laws governing family relations are very simple. The father has
theoretically absolute power of life and death over his wife, children,
and slaves. In practice, however, this power is seldom used to its full
extent. An arbitrary exercise of domestic authority over his wife and
children would arouse the antagonism of her relatives and lead to a
rupture of friendly relations. Hence, in family dealings there are
displayed on one side paternal affection and leniency and on the other
filial devotion and a sense of duty, so much so that the members of the
family live in peace and happiness with seldom a domestic grievance.</p>

<p>The wife, of course, is the absolute property of her husband, but is
rarely, if ever, sold. I know of only one wife who was sold and she was
a Bisáya woman married to a recently Christianized Manóbo.</p>

<p>It is not in accord with Manóbo custom for a man to have two or more
wives unless the first wife consents to the later marriages, and, if she
does consent, she must always be considered the man's favorite and must
be allowed to have a kind of motherly jurisdiction over the other wives.
In all cases that have come under my observation, this rule was followed
among Manóbos but not among Mandáyas. The latter frequently seem more
attached to their second, third, or fourth wives, but do not separate
the first wife either from bed or board. As a result of the necessity of
the first wife's consent to a second marriage, bigamy is comparatively
rare.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K35"></a>
<h5>RESIDENCE OF THE HUSBAND</h5>
</center>

<p>The man is always expected to take up his residence in his wife's
family and he nearly always does so. In fact, such is the implied and
frequently the explicit contract made between his relatives and those of
the girl. But after a few years, if not sooner, he usually takes his
wife back to his own clan, leaving his father-in-law or other male
relative of his wife some gift in the shape of a pig or other payment.
In such a case it seems to be the custom for the father-in-law to
acquiesce.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K4"></a>
<h4>CRIMES AND THEIR PENALTIES</h4>

<a name="3K41"></a>
<h5>CRIMES</h5>
</center>

<p>It must be laid down as a general principle that in Manóboland it is
considered proper and obligatory to seek redress for all wrongs (except
a few serious ones) by an appeal to the relatives of the wrongdoer,
either directly by a formal meeting or indirectly through the mediation
of a third party. The first exceptions to this rule are cases of
adultery, fornication, rape, and homicide when the murderer, wantonly,
and without an attempt to arbitrate, kills a fellow man. The great law
of vengeance presupposes in nearly every case a recourse to arbitration,
and not a hasty, unannounced, deliberate killing.</p>

<p>The one who orders the death of another or in any other way
deliberately causes it is the one on whom vengeance must be taken. Thus,
if A pays a neutral warrior chief to kill his opponent, the
responsibility for the death will be laid, not on the warrior who did
the killing (unless he had personal motives for committing the murder)
but on the one who ordered the death. The warrior was paid and
accordingly bears no responsibility. He may be paid again by the
relatives of the slain to do a similar act to their enemies. Thus it is,
that in Manóboland, it is very necessary to be on such terms of
friendship with the members of the warrior class that they will not be
inclined to undertake for payment the task of taking vengeance for
another.</p>

<p>Killing for public policy is a recognized institution, but such
executions very seldom take place. On the upper Tágo River word was sent
to me that my guide would be killed if he led me into a certain remote
region at the headwaters of that river. It was reported on all sides
that the principal chiefs of the region had assembled before my
departure and had decided upon his death. For some reason, probably
fear, the sentence was not carried into effect.</p>

<p>It was reported to me that in time of an epidemic it is permitted to
kill anyone who dares to break the quarantine.</p>

<p>Involuntary killing when it is manifest that it was a pure accident
can be compounded.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K42"></a>
<h5>THE PRIVATE SEIZURE</h5>
</center>

<p>By the <i>tawágan</i> system a Manóbo is permitted to kill or seize
anything or anybody that he may decide upon, <i>provided that he has
made every endeavor to settle the dispute by amicable means</i>. Having
failed to adjust the matter without bloodshed, he may avenge himself,
first and above all, on the guilty party. I will not make a positive
statement to the effect that he must announce his intention to make use
of the right accorded him by the <i>tawágan</i> custom, but I am of
opinion that this must be done, for in every instance that came under my
observation it had been generally known beforehand that the aggrieved
party would make a seizure within a specified time. I know that on one
occasion I had to exact a promise from a man that he would not lay hands
on merchandise of mine that was deposited under a house in the vicinity
of his settlement. He had made public announcement that he would make a
seizure, even though it should be that of my merchandise.</p>

<p>The aggrieved party in making use of his right must, if possible,
inflict damage, even death, upon the debtor or other wrongdoer or on
some of his relatives, but should this prove impracticable he is at
liberty to select anyone. If he kills a neutral party, he must compound
with the relatives of the slain one for the death inflicted and enter
with them into a solemn promise to act jointly against the offending
party. In the case of seizure, he can not dispose of the object seized
until the owner be consulted. It is customary for the two to enter a
compact by which they bind themselves to take joint action against the
offender, advantageous terms being guaranteed to the new colleague. The
man whose property is thus seized is very often one who has had an
old-time grudge against the original offender or debtor.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K43"></a>
<h5>PENALTIES FOR MINOR OFFENSES</h5>
</center>

<p>Minor offenses such as stealing, slandering, failure to pay debts,
deception that causes material damage to another, loss or damage to
another's property, the lesser violations of sexual propriety,
disrespect to another's property, etc., are punishable by fines that
must be determined by the assembled relatives of the two parties. I have
never been able to find the least trace of any definite system of fines.
In the determination of them for the more serious of offenses (adultery,
wanton killing, etc.), the equivalent of a human life, 15 or 30 pesos,
is the basis of the calculation. In the case of minor offenses, however,
lesser quantities are determined upon after a lengthy discussion of the
subject by the respective relatives of the parties involved.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K5"></a>
<h4>CUSTOMARY PROCEDURE</h4>

<a name="3K51"></a>
<h5>PRELIMINARIES TO ARBITRATION</h5>
</center>

<p>The aggrieved party, upon hearing of the offense and after making
many futile efforts to come to an agreement, consults with his
relatives, when, after being assured of their cooperation he begins to
issue threats, all of which reach the ear of his opponent. At first the
latter probably is not disturbed by these, but, as they begin to pour in
from all sources, he makes up his mind either to face his opponent in
person, if the affair has not gone too far, or to look around for a
friendly chief or other person of influence and sagacity to mediate. All
this time new rumors of his enemy's anger and determination to appeal to
arms reach him, but he must not display cowardice, neither must his
opponent openly seek arbitration, for such an action would bespeak fear
on both sides. So, on the part of the aggrieved one, there is menace,
revenge, and a pretense at least not to be amenable to peaceable
measures. On the part of the other, there must be no display of fear, no
hurry to arbitrate, and a general indifference, at least simulated, as
to the outcome. If the offending party answers threat by threat, his
opponent may become incensed and hostilities may break out, as happens
in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>In the meantime neighboring chiefs and influential people are
throwing the weight of their opinions in favor of peace and if they
prevail one or more of them are requested to assist in the final
settlement, definite emolument sometimes being promised, especially when
either of the contending parties is very anxious to have the matter
settled.</p>

<p>It is the duty now of the mediating chiefs or other persons to bring
the parties together. This they do either by inviting the contestants to
a neutral house or by persuading one of them to invite the other to his
house.</p>

<p>It may happen that the aggrieved party, instead of following this
procedure, precipitates a settlement by sending a fighting bolo or a
dagger or a lance to his opponent. This is an ultimatum. If the weapon
is retained it means hostilities. If it is returned, it denotes a
willingness to submit the matter to arbitration. But the one who
receives the weapon probably will not return it at once as he desires to
disguise, in the presence of his opponent's emissary, the bearer of the
ultimatum, any eagerness he may feel for arbitration. Once having
decided that he will submit the matter to arbitration or that he will
yield, he announces to the messenger that he will visit his opponent
within a specified period and talk matters over and that he is willing
to have the affair settled but that his relatives are unwilling. If a
bolo or other such object has been sent to him he returns it, for to
retain it would signify his unwillingness to submit and his readiness to
take the consequences.</p>

<p>A few days before the appointed time he orders drink to be made and
he may go out on a big fishing expedition. He procures also a pig or
two. With these, and accompanied by a host of male relatives, he sets
out for the house that has been agreed upon. The pigs and drink and
other things are deposited in a convenient place near the house, for it
would be impolitic to display such proofs of his willingness to
yield.</p>

<p>This is the procedure followed in more serious cases. Cases of lesser
importance, which occur with great frequency, are settled almost
informally in the following manner:</p>

<p>When the subject under dispute is not of such a serious nature,
either in itself or by reason of aggravating circumstances, like
quarrels or violent language that may have preceded it, the ordinary
method of settling the trouble consists in a good meal given by one
party to the other. Toward the end of the repast, when all present are
feeling convivial from the effects of the drink, the question at issue,
usually a debt, is taken up and discussed by the parties concerned and
their respective relatives. It happens often that the matter is put off
to another time, and thus it may require several semifriendly meetings
to settle it. On the whole, however, the proceedings are terminated
amicably, although I have seen a few very animated scenes at such times.
On one occasion a member of the party, accompanied by his relatives,
rushed down the pole and seizing his lance and shield challenged his
adversary to single combat. The challenge was not accepted, so he and
his party marched away vowing vengeance. I have seen bolos or daggers
drawn on many occasions but the relatives and others always intervened
to prevent bloodshed. It is to be noted that such violent actions are
due often to the influence of drink but do not take place more
frequently than drunken brawls do in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>When the case in question is of such an involved and serious
character as to make it dangerous for the accused one to enter the
house, he remains hidden till he ascertains how his relatives and
friends are progressing. In other cases he personally attends and may
argue in his own defense.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p><sup>1</sup>There is a very formal peace-making procedure followed by
the Manóbos who have been in contact with the Banuáons of Maásam River,
but I never witnessed it, so I can not give any first-hand information
as to the details. In the chapter on war will be found such details as
have been given to me by trustworthy Bisáyas of Talakógon.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K52"></a>
<h5>GENERAL FEATURES OF A GREATER ARBITRATION</h5>
</center>

<p>The general features of the procedure are the following: The policy
of the aggrieved one and of his party is to maintain a loud, menacing
attitude, and to insist on a fine three or four hundred times larger
than they expect to be paid. The accused and his relatives keep up a
firm attitude, not so firm, however, as to incense unduly their
opponents, and from the beginning make an offer of a paltry sum in
payment.</p>

<p>Although everybody at times may break into the discussion, or all may
yell at the same time, the ordinary procedure is to allow each one to
speak singly and to finish what he has to say. The others listen and
assent by such expressions as correspond to our &#34;yes indeed,&#34;
&#34;true,&#34; etc., whether they are in accord with the speaker's
opinions or not. These lengthy talks are, at least to an outsider, most
wearisome, given, as they are, in a dreary monotone, but they explain
the inordinate length of arbitrations that may last for several days.</p>

<p>The whole party is squatted on the floor and makes use of grains of
corn, of pieces of wood or leaf, of the bamboo slats of the floor, of
their fingers and toes or of anything convenient, to aid them in the
enumeration of the objects of which they treat. Everybody is armed,
probably with his hand on his weapon, and his eyes alert. In very
serious cases women and children may not be present. This, of course, is
an indication of possible bloodshed and is a very rare occurrence.</p>

<p>The chiefs or other influential men who have been selected to aid
each side in the settlement take a conspicuous part in the proceedings
and help to influence the parties concerned to come to an understanding,
but it can not be said that their word is paramount. The contestants'
own relatives have more weight than anyone else. The procedure at a
Manóbo arbitration may be likened to that of a jury when in retirement.
Point after point is discussed, similitudes and allegories are brought
up by each speaker until, after wearisome hours or days, the opinion of
each side has been molded sufficiently to bring them into agreement. In
one respect it differs from the jury method in that loud shouts and
threats are made use of occasionally, proceeding either from natural
vehemence or from a deliberate intention on one side to intimidate the
other.</p>

<p>It is not good form for the defendant to yield readily. On the
contrary, it is in accordance with Manóbo custom and character to yield
with reluctance, feigned if not real. When a small pig is really
considered a sufficient payment, a large one is demanded. When the pig
is received and is really in conformity with the contract, defects are
found in it--it is lean or sick or short or light in weight--in a word,
it is depreciated in one way or another. The giver, on the contrary,
exaggerates its value, descants on its size, length, form, and weight,
tells of the exorbitant price he paid for it, reminds the receiver of
the difficulty of procuring pigs at this season, and in general
manifests his reluctance to part with it.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that such actions and statements are believed
at once. On the contrary, it is only after lengthy talks on each side
that opinions are formed, an agreement entered into, a contract is drawn
up, or reparation made. It is the identical case of stubborn jurymen.</p>

<p>In the settlement of these disputes much depends upon the glibness of
tongue and on the sagacity of one or more of the principal men. For were
it not for their skill in understanding the intricacies of the subject
and in sidetracking irrelevant claims the disputes would be impossible
of satisfactory arrangement. This will be understood more readily if it
is borne in mind that outside of the reasonable facts of the case,
counterclaims are made by the debtor or the accused party. These claims
are sometimes of an extraordinary nature and date back to the time of
his grandfather or other distant relative. Thus he may say that his
opponent's great uncle owed his grandfather a human life and that this
blood debt has never been paid nor revenge obtained. Such an affirmation
as this will be corroborated by his relatives and they may immediately
break out into menaces of vengeance. Again, he may aver that his
opponent was reputed to have had a charm by which death might be caused,
and that his son had died as a result of this use of evil magic powers.
Whereupon the other vigorously repudiates the imputation and demands a
slave in payment of the slander. It is only the popularity of the chief
men, their reputation for fair dealing, their sagacity, and perhaps
their relationship with the respective contestants that dispose of such
side issues and bring about an amicable and satisfactory settlement.</p>

<p>It is customary for the one who loses to regale the assembly with a
good meal. In Manóbo-land this latter is the great solace for all ills
and the source of all friendship. So, when the question under dispute
has been settled, the one who lost sends out and gets the pig and drink
that have been brought for that purpose. When prepared, the food is set
out on the floor, the guests are distributed in due order, and then
begins one of those meals that must be witnessed in order to be
understood. One feature of this feast is that the two former adversaries
are seated together and vie with each other in reciprocating food and
drink. As they warm up under the influence of the liquor they load large
masses of food into each other's mouths, each with an arm around the
other's neck.</p>

<p>Upon the following day, or perhaps that same day, the winner of the
case reciprocates with another banquet. When that is finished, the other
party may give another banquet and so they may continue, if their means
permit, for many days. I assisted at one peacemaking in which the
banqueting lasted for 10 successive days.</p>

<a name="3K6"></a>
<h4>DETERMINATION OF GUILT</h4>

<a name="3K61"></a>
<h5>BY WITNESSES</h5>
</center>

<p>The usual and natural method of determining the guilt of the accused
is through the instrumentality of witnesses. They are questioned and
requestioned at great length even if the defendant be not present. There
seems to be no necessity for this procedure, for the defendant admits
his guilt when brought face to face with the plaintiff or with the
witnesses. The testimony of children is not only admissible but is
considered conclusive. That of a woman testifying against a man for
improper suggestions and acts is considered sufficient to convict
him.</p>

<p>False testimony in the presence of witnesses and relatives is almost
unheard of. I suppose that this marvel is to be attributed to the fear
of the dire retribution that would infallibly overtake the false
witness.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K62"></a>
<h5>BY OATHS</h5>
</center>

<p>Ordinarily no oath is administered nor any other formal means adopted
to make certain that the accused or the witnesses will tell the truth,
but there is a practice which is sometimes followed whenever the
veracity of anyone is doubted. This is called <i>tó-tung</i> or burning
of the wax, a ceremony that may be used not only with witnesses but with
anyone from whom it is desired to force the truth. I have used it very
successfully on numerous occasions in getting information about trails.
The ceremony consists in burning a piece of beeswax in the presence of
the party to be questioned. This signifies that if he does not answer
truthfully his body by some process of sympathetic magic, will be burned
in a similar manner. After making his statement and while the wax is
being burned, he expresses the desire that his body may burn and be
melted like the wax if his statement is untrue. This is another example
of the pervading belief in sympathetic magic.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K63"></a>
<h5>BY THE TESTIMONY OF THE ACCUSED</h5>
</center>

<p>In the various instances that have come under my observation, the
guilty one, as a rule, vigorously denied his guilt until confronted in
public assembly by his accusers, so that I judge that custom does not
require him to make a self-accusation until that time. But when duly
confronted with witnesses, he nearly always admits his guilt.</p>

<p>For if the defendant should deny his guilt and if there were no
evidence against him other than suspicion, the injured party would be
justified in inflicting injury on anyone else, according to the
principles of the private-seizure system. If it should later be
discovered that the defendant was the original offender, the innocent
parties who were the victims of this seizure would ultimately take
terrible vengeance on him. I was informed by the Debabáons that a false
denial of one's guilt before the assembled arbiters and relatives is
especially displeasing to the deities. I failed to get information on
this point from Manóbos, but it would be fairly reasonable to conclude
that their belief in the matter is identical with that of the
Debabáons.</p>

<p>Should the accused one deny his guilt and should circumstantial
evidence point to him as the guilty one, the wax-burning ceremony above
described would be performed. If he should still maintain that he was
innocent, various methods for the determination of his guilt would be
resorted to.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K64"></a>
<h5>BY ORDEALS</h5>

<p>The tests made to determine the innocence or guilt of a person are
threefold: (1) the hot-water ordeal, (2) the diving ordeal, and (3) the
candle ordeal.</p>

<a name="3K641"></a>
<p><i>The hot-water ordeal</i>.<sup>2</sup>--A brass anklet, armlet, or
similar metal object is put into boiling water in one of the iron pans
so common throughout the Agúsan Valley. The suspected party, or parties,
is then called upon to insert a hand into the water and to remove the
object that has been placed at the bottom of the shallow pan. Although I
have heard many threats of an appeal to this test, I never saw the
actual operation of it, but I have been assured repeatedly by those who
claimed to have seen the performance that the hand of the guilty one
gets badly scalded, while that of an innocent one remains uninjured. The
belief in the truth of this test is so strong, that, at times when the
ordeal was threatened, I have heard many express not only their
willingness but their eagerness to undergo it.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>Pag-ínit</i>.</p>

<p>I have made numerous and very definite inquires in different
localities and from members of different tribes as to the reason for the
value of the ordeal as a test and as to whether or not it might be
explained by the agency of supernatural beings, but in reply always
received the answer that no reason could be given except that it had
always been so and that religion had no connection with it.</p>

<a name="3K642"></a>
<p><i>The diving ordeal</i>.<sup>3</sup>--I never witnessed the actual
operation of this ordeal except in play, but the belief in its efficacy
is strong and widespread. The operation consists in a trial between the
parties under suspicion as to the length of time they can remain under
water. Two at a time undergo the test. The one that retains his head
under water longer is declared innocent for the time being, but has to
undergo the test with each one of the suspected parties. This method
seems impossible as a final proof, but such is the procedure as
described to me on the upper Tágo River.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Sún-ub</i>.</p>

<p>Another and more common method is a simultaneous trial by all the
accused. At a given signal they submerge their heads. The one that first
raises his from the water is declared guilty. I was told by one party
that the respective relatives of the accused ones stand by and hold them
down by main force. This statement was corroborated by all those present
at the time, but, as neither my informant nor anyone else could explain
what it would be necessary to do in case of asphyxiation, I do not give
credence to the story.</p>

<p>On numerous occasions I made diving tests in sport with Manóbos and
found that I could retain my breath longer than they could. They assured
me, nevertheless, that if the test were made as an ordeal and if I were
the guilty party, I would infallibly lose.</p>

<a name="3K643"></a>
<p><i>The candle ordeal</i>.--Among the Christianized Manóbos of the
lake region I found the belief in the efficacy of the candle ordeal for
determining the guilt of one of the suspected parties. Candles of the
same size are made and are given to the suspects, one to each of them.
They are then stuck to the floor and lit at the same time. The
contestants have the right to keep them erect and to protect them from
the wind. The one whose candle burns out first is declared guilty.</p>

<p>A belief in the value of ordeals is widespread, but the actual
practice of them is very rare. No reason for this has been given to me,
although it is stated that the refusal to submit to one would be
considered evidence of guilt.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K65"></a>
<h5>BY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</h5>
</center>

<p>In Manóboland circumstantial evidence, in the absence of other
evidence, has sufficient weight to convict one who is under suspicion.
Hence footprints and other traces of a man's presence are carefully
examined. In fact, as a gatherer of testimony, even of the most
insignificant kind, the Manóbo is peerless; he is patient, ceaseless,
and thorough. This is due, no doubt, to his cautious, suspicious nature
and to that spirit of revenge that never smolders. He may wait for years
until the suspicion seems to have died out, when one fine day he hears a
rumor that confirms his suspicions and the flame of contention bursts
forth. One by one the successive bearers of the incriminating rumor are
questioned in open meeting until the truth of it is ascertained and the
guilty one brought to justice. I have known many cases, principally of
slander, traced in this way from one rumor bearer to another. This
illustrates the statement made before that in cases involving damage or
loss to another the guilty party and the witnesses as a rule declare the
truth, when they are called upon, knowing that one day or another the
secret will probably be ferreted out and then the punishment will be
greater.</p>

<center>
<a name="3K7"></a>
<h4>ENFORCEMENT OF THE SENTENCE</h4>
</center>

<p>The sentence having been agreed to by the consensus of opinion of
both sides, and the defendant having manifested his concurrence therein,
a time is set for the payment. When the offense is of a very serious
character, partial payment is made at once, the object being to mollify
the feelings of the enraged plaintiff. This payment ordinarily consists
of a weapon belonging either to the defendant himself or to one of his
relatives, but in urgent cases it might be a human being, as a relative
for instance. I myself saw delivery of a son made after the termination
of an adultery case.</p>

<p>The whole payment or compensation is not exacted at once but a
suitable length of time for the completion of it is always agreed upon.
The defendant receives a strip of rattan with a number of knots and is
at times made to take the wax-burning oath.</p>

<p>His conduct on these occasions is apparently submissive for he does
not want to run counter to tribal opinion, but it happens sometimes that
upon leaving the house of adjudication he expresses his dissatisfaction
with the decision or throws the blame upon somebody else. In this case
there may arise another contention. On the whole, however, he abides by
the decision.</p>

<p>In the great majority of cases the convicted man makes the stipulated
payment, for a refusal to do so would lead to more serious difficulties
than those already settled, and excuses for nonfulfillment are not
accepted as readily as before. Moreover, a second arbitration subjects
his opponent and his opponent's relatives to unnecessary trouble and
long journeys. Hence, realizing that a second trial will only serve to
exasperate his opponent and arm public opinion against him, he fulfills
his obligations faithfully.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>
<h3>POLITICAL ORGANIZATION: INTERTRIBAL AND OTHER RELATIONS</h3>

<a name="3L1"></a>
<h4>INTERTRIBAL RELATIONS</h4>
</center>

<p>Dealings on the part of. Manóbos with other tribes such as the
Banuáon, the Debabáon, and the Mandáya are almost without exception of
the most pacific kind. I made frequent inquiries, especially while on
the upper Agúsan River, as to the reason for this, and was always given
to understand that any trouble with another tribe was carefully avoided
because it might give rise to unending complications and to interminable
war. I am of the opinion that, in his avoidance of war with neighboring
tribes, there is ever present in the Manóbo's mind a consciousness of
his inferiority to the Mandáya, Debabáon, and Banuáon, and a realization
of the consequences that would inevitably follow in case of a clash with
them. Thus the Manóbos of the upper Agúsan, who had provoked the
Mandáyas of the Katí'il River at the beginning of the Christian
conquest, suffered a dire reprisal on the Húlip River, upper Agúsan,
when some 180 of them were massacred in one night.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p><sup>1</sup>See Oartas de los PP. de la Compañía de Jesús, 5:22,
1883.</p>

<p>The current accounts of Debabáon warriors, as narrated to me by many
of them on the upper Sálug River, show the severe losses suffered by
Manóbos of the upper Agúsan in their conflicts with Debabáons. The same
holds true of the Manóbos on the lower Agúsan when they matched their
strength with the Banuáons of the Maásam, Líbañg, and Óhut Rivers. A
perusal of the &#34;Cartas de los PP. de la Compañía de Jesús&#34; will
give one a vivid picture of the devastation caused by not only the
Banuáons but by the Mandáyas and the Debabáons in Manóboland.</p>

<p>The reason for these unfriendly intertribal relations and for the
consequent defeats of the Manóbos in nearly every instance is not far to
seek. The Manóbo lacks the organization of the Mandáya, Debabáon, and
Banuáon. Like the Mañgguáñgan he is somewhat hot-headed, and upon
provocation, especially while drunk, prefers to take justice into his
own hands, striking down with one fell swoop his Mandáya or other
adversary, without appealing to a public adjudication. The result of
this imprudent proceeding is an attack in which the friends and
relatives of the slain one become the aggressors, invading Manóbo
territory and executing awful vengeance upon the perpetrator of the
wrong. The friends and relatives of the latter, with their inferior
tribal organization and their conscious feeling of inferiority in
courage, together with a realization of the innumerable difficulties
that beset the path of reprisals, very rarely invade the territory of
the hostile tribe.</p>

<p>Both from the accounts given in the aforesaid Jesuit letters and from
my own observations and information, I know that the same statements may
be made of the intertribal relations of Mañgguáñgans and Mandáyas,
Mañgguáñgans and Debabáons, and Mañgguáñgans and Manóbos. The
Mañgguáñgans are much lower in the scale of culture than the Manóbos,
and when they are under the influence of liquor yield to very slight
provocation. As a result of a rash blow, the Mañgguáñgan's territory is
invaded and his settlement is surrounded. He is an arrant coward as a
rule, and, hot-headed fool as he is, jumps from his low, wall-less house
only to meet the foeman's lance. Thus it happens that thousands and
thousands of them have been killed. If we may believe the testimony of a
certain Jesuit missionary, as stated in one of the Jesuit letters, the
Mañgguáñgan tribe numbered 30,000 at one time and their habitat extended
eastward from the Tágum River and from its eastern tributary, the Sálug,
between the Híjo and the Tótui Rivers, to the Agúsan and thence spread
still eastward over the Simúlau River. In 1886 Father Pastells estimated
them to number some 14,000. In 1910, I made an estimate, based on the
reports of their hereditary enemies in Compostela, Gandía, Geróna, and
Moncáyo, and venture to state that in that year they did not number more
than about 10,000 souls. Their territory, too, at that date, was
confined to the low range of mountains that formed the Agúsan-Sálug
divide and to the swamp tracts in the region of the Mánat River, with a
scattered settlement here and there on the east of the Agúsan to the
north of the Mánat River.</p>

<p>The Manóbos of the Ihawán, Baóbo, and Agúsan Rivers played a bloody
part in the massacre of the Mañgguáñgans. While on my first visit to the
upper Agúsan in 1907, I used to hear once or twice a week of the killing
of Mañgguáñgans. Many a time my Mandáya or Manóbo or Debabáon companions
would say to me, upon seeing a Mañgguáñgan: &#34;Shoot him, grandpa, he
is only a Mañgguáñgan.&#34;</p>

<p>I know from the personal accounts of Manóbo, Mandáya, and Debabáon
warrior chiefs that in nearly every case they had acquired their title
of warrior chief by bloody attacks made upon Mañgguáñgans. The warrior
chiefs of the upper Agúsan, upper Karága, upper Manorígau and upper and
middle Katí'il had nearly to a man earned their titles from the killing
of Mañgguáñgans. This is eminently true of the Debabáon group. Moncáyo
itself boasts of more warrior chiefs than any district in eastern
Mindanáo, and stands like a mighty watchtower over the thousands and
thousands of Mañgguáñgan and Manóbo graves that bestrew the lonely
forest from Libagánon to the Agúsan.</p>

<center>
<a name="3L2"></a>
<h4>INTERCLAN RELATIONS</h4>
</center>

<p>It must be borne in mind that, judging from the testimony of all with
whom I conversed on the subject as well as from my own personal
observation, interclan feuds among Manóbos have diminished notably since
the beginning of missionary activity and more especially since the
establishment of the special government in the Agúsan Valley. Upon the
establishment of this government in the lower half of the Agúsan Valley,
there was a perceptible decrease in bloody fights due to the effective
extension of supervision under able and active officials. Here and there
in remote regions, such as the upper reaches of the Baóbo, Ihawán,
Umaíam, Argáwan, and Kasilaían Rivers, casual killings took place. On
the upper Agúsan, however, where no effective government had been
established until after my departure in 1910, interclan relations were
not of the most pacific nature. Thus, in 1909, the settlements of
Dugmánon and Moncáyo were in open hostility, and up to the time of my
departure four deaths had occurred. The Mandáyas of Katí'il and
Manorígao had contemplated an extensive movement against Compostela and
after my departure did bring about one death. However, the intended move
was frustrated happily by the establishment of a military post in
Moncáyo in 1910. Several Mañgguáñgans at the headwaters of the Mánat
River met their fate in 1909. The whole Mañgguáñgan tribe went into
armed vigilance that same year and rendered it impossible for me to meet
any but the milder members of the tribe living in the vicinity of
Compostela. On one occasion I had made arrangements to meet a
Mañgguáñgan warrior chief at an appointed trysting place in the forest.
Upon arriving at the spot, one of my companions beat the buttress of a
tree as a signal that we had arrived, but it was more than an hour
before our Mañgguáñgan friends made their appearance. Upon being
questioned as to the delay, they informed us that they had circled
around at a considerable distance, examining the number and shape of our
footprints in order to make sure that no deception was being practiced
upon them. When we approached the purpose of the interview, namely, to
request permission to visit their houses, they positively refused to
allow it, telling us that they were on guard against three warrior
chiefs of the upper Sálug who had recently procured guns and who had
threatened to attack them. Upon questioning my companions as to the
likely location of the domicile of the Mañgguáñgans, I was assured that
they probably lived at the head of the Mánat River in a swampy region
and that access to their settlement could be had only by wading through
tracts of mud and water thigh deep.</p>

<p>During the same year various other raids were made, notably on the
watershed between the Sálug and the Ihawán Rivers. The Manóbos of the
Baóbo River, which has been styled by the well-known Jesuit missionary
Urios &#34;the river of Bagáni&#34; (warrior chiefs), were reported to
be in a state of interclan war. Such a condition, however, was nothing
unusual, for I never ascended the upper Agúsan without hearing reports
of atrocities on Baóbo River.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><sup>2</sup>The Baóbo River rises in a mountain that is very near the
confluence of the Sálug and Libagánon Rivers, and empties into one of
the myriad channels into which the Agúsan is divided just below
Veruéla.</p>

<p>In time of peace, interclan dealings are friendly, but it may be said
in general that dealings of any kind are not numerous and that their
frequency is in inverse ratio to the distance between the two clans. It
is seldom that a given individual has no feudal enemy in one district or
another so that in his visits to other clans he usually has either to
pass through the territory of an enemy or to run the risk of meeting one
at his destination. This does not mean that he will be attacked then and
there, for he is on his guard, but it must be remembered that he is in
Manóboland and that a mere spark may start a conflagration.</p>

<p>Hence, visits to others than relatives and trips to distant points
are not frequent. This is particularly true of the womenfolk. Here and
there one finds a Manóbo man who travels fearlessly to distant
settlements for the purpose of securing some object that he needs, but
he never fails to carry his lance, and frequently, his shield; he is
never off his guard, either on the trail or in the house he may be
visiting.</p>

<p>During the greater social and religious gatherings the greatest
vigilance is exerted by all concerned as everyone realizes beforehand
the possibility of trouble. Hence bolos or daggers are worn even during
meals. Enemies or others who are known to be at loggerheads are seated
at a respectful distance from each other with such people around them as
are considered friendly or at least neutral. This arrangement of guests
is a very striking feature of a Manóbo meal and one of great importance,
for it prevents many an untoward act. The host, in an informal way, sees
to the distribution of the guests, and when his arrangement is not
acceptable to any of the interested parties, a rearrangement is made and
all seat themselves. This proceeding has nothing formal about it. The
whole thing seems to be done by instinct.</p>

<a name="3L3"></a>
<h4>EXTERNAL COMMERCIAL RELATIONS</h4>

<a name="3L31"></a>
<h5>EXPLOITATION BY CHRISTIAN NATIVES</h5>
</center>

<p>The shameless spoliation<sup>3</sup> practiced during my residence
and travels in eastern Mindanáo (1905-1909) by Christian natives upon
the Christianized and un-Christianized Manóbos is a subject that
deserves special mention.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Since the establishment in 1909 of government trading
posts, this spoliation has practically ceased in the Agúsan Valley.</p>

<a name="3L311"></a>
<p><i>Exploitation by falsification</i>.--The hill people, living in
their mountain fastnesses out of communication with the more important
traders, had to depend wholly for their needs on petty traders and
peddlers of the Christian population. They were accordingly kept in
absolute ignorance of the true value of the commodities that they
required. False reports as to the value of rice, hemp, and <i>vino</i>
were constantly spread. To-day, it would be a report of a war between
China and Japan that caused a rise of several pesos in the price of a
sack of rice. To-morrow, it would be an international complication
between Japan and several of the great European powers which caused a
paralysis in the exportation of hemp and a corresponding fall of several
pesos in the value of it. These and numerous other fabrications were
corroborated by letters purporting to come from Butuán, but in most
cases written by one trader to another on the spot, with a view to
giving plausibility to the lie. It was a common practice for the
trader's friend or partner in Butuán to direct, usually by previous
arrangement, two letters to him, in one of which was stated the true
value of the commodity and in the other the value at which it was
desired to purchase or to dispose of it. The latter letter was for
public perusal and rarely failed to beguile the ignorant
<i>conquistas</i> and Manóbos.</p>

<p>But it was not only in the exorbitant rates charged and in the
unspeakably low prices paid for objects of merchandise that the
Christian trader swindled his pagan fellow men. The use of false weights
and measures was a second means. The Manóbo had little conception of a
<i>pikul</i><sup>4</sup> or of an <i>arroba</i><sup>5</sup> of hemp, so
that he was utterly at the mercy of the trader. The steelyards used by
Christian traders from 1905 to 1908 were never less than 30 per cent out
of true and frequently as much as 50 per cent. One pair of scales I
found to be so heavily leaded that the hemp that weighed 25 pounds on
them weighed between 38 and 39 pounds on a true English scales.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>A <i>pikul</i> is the equivalent of 137.5 Spanish
pounds.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>An <i>arroba</i> is 25 Spanish pounds.</p>

<p>Another method of defraudation consisted in false accounts. The
Manóbo had no account book to rely upon in his dealings with the trader,
but trusted to his memory and to the honesty of his friend. The payment
was made in occasional deliveries of hemp or other articles, such
deliveries covering a period usually of many months. When the day for
settling accounts came, the Manóbo was allowed to spread out his little
grains of corn or little bits of wood on the floor and to perform the
calculation as best he could. Any mistakes in his own favor were
promptly corrected by the trader, but mistakes or omissions in favor of
the trader were allowed to pass unobserved. The account would then be
closed and the trader would mark with a piece of charcoal on a beam,
rafter, or other convenient place, the amount of the debt still due him,
for it was extremely rare that he allowed the poor tribesman to escape
from his clutches.</p>

<a name="3L312"></a>
<p><i>Defraudation by usury and excessive prices</i>.--Another method of
exploitation consisted in a system of usury, practiced throughout the
valley but more especially on the upper Agúsan. An example will
illustrate this: A Bisáya advances 5 pesos in various commodities with
the understanding that at the next harvest he is to receive 10 sacks of
paddy in payment. At the next harvest the Manóbo is unable to pay more
than 6 sacks. He is given to understand that he must pay the balance
within two months. After that period the trader goes upstream again and
proceeds to collect. The paddy is not forthcoming, so the trader informs
his customer that the prevailing price of paddy in such and such a town
is actually 5 pesos per sack and that he accordingly loses 20 pesos by
the failure to receive the paddy stipulated for and that the debtor must
answer for the amount. The poor Manóbo then turns over a war bolo or
perhaps a spear at one-half their original value, for the contract
called for paddy and not weapons. In that way he pays up a certain
amount, let us say 10 pesos, and has still a balance of 10 pesos against
him, he having no available resources wherewith to settle the account in
full. He is then offered the alternative of paying 20 sacks at the next
harvest or of performing some work that he is unwilling to do, so he
accepts the former alternative. The bargain is then clinched with many
threats on the part of the trader to the effect that the Americans will
cut off his head or commit some other outrageous act should he fail to
fulfill this second contract.</p>

<p>The worst depredation committed on the Manóbo consisted of the
advancing of merchandise at exorbitant rates just before harvest time
with a view to purchasing rice and tobacco. It is principally at this
time that the Manóbo stands in special need of a supply of pigs and
chickens for the celebrations, religious and social, that invariably
take place. As he has little foresight in his nature and rarely, if
ever, speculates, he was accustomed to bartering away in advance a large
amount of his paddy and tobacco. The result was that after paying up as
much of his paddy debts and tobacco debts as he could, he found that his
stock was meager, barely sufficient for a few months. So the time came
when he had to repurchase at from 3 to 10 pesos per bamboo joint that
which he had sold for 25 centavos.</p>

<a name="3L313"></a>
<p><i>Exploitation by the system of commutation</i>.--Another means of
defrauding perpetrated on the Manóbo was the system of commutation by
which the debt had to be paid, if the creditor so desired, in other
effects than those which were stipulated in the contract. The value of
the goods thus substituted was reckoned extraordinarily low. For
example, in the event of a failure to pay the stipulated amount of
tobacco, its value in some other part of the Agúsan, where that
commodity was high, would be calculated in money, and any object would
be asked for that the trader might desire. Suppose the customary value
of this object, a pig for instance, to be 10 pesos, at which price it
would be offered to the trader, who would reply that he had contracted
for tobacco and not pigs. He would go on to show that he had no use for
pigs, that he could procure a pig of the same size for 2 pesos in
another town, and he would finally persuade the debtor to turn over the
pig for 2 pesos.</p>

<p>I adjudicated unofficially, at the request of the Manóbos, several
cases where the Bisáya trader tried to collect not only the value of a
sow but of the number of young ones that it might have given birth to
had it lived. These pigs had been left with Manóbos for safe-keeping and
either had died from natural causes or had been killed. One Bisáya went
so far as to demand payment for the chickens that a hen would have
produced had it not been stolen from the Manóbo to whom it had been
entrusted. This part of the claim I did not allow, so the claimant
demanded pay for the eggs that might have been laid.</p>

<a name="3L314"></a>
<p><i>Wheedling or the puának system</i>.--Another means of exploitation
practiced on the Manóbos of the upper Agúsan was the <i>puának</i>
system, invented by the Bisáya trader. The <i>puának</i> was some
prosperous Manóbo who was chosen as an intimate friend and who, out of
friendship, was expected to furnish his Bisáya friend anything which the
latter might ask for. The Bisáya in return was expected to do the
same.</p>

<p>The Bisáya paid his Manóbo friend a few visits every year, on which
occasions he was received with all the open-hearted hospitality so
characteristic of the Manóbo. Pigs and chickens, purchased frequently at
high rates, were killed in his honor. The country was scoured for
sugar-cane wine or other drink, and no means were left untried to make
the reception royal. The Bisáya, in the meanwhile, lavished on his host
soft, wheedling words, at the same time giving him sad tales of the rise
in the price of merchandise, of his indebtedness to the Chinese, and
before leaving gave him a little cloth or some other thing of small
value. In return he received paddy, tobacco, and such other articles as
he needed. The farewell was made with great demonstrations of friendship
on the Bisáya's part and with an invitation to his Manóbo friend to
visit him at a certain stated time.</p>

<p>During his friend's visit the Manóbo had gone around the country
canvassing for paddy and such other articles as he had been instructed
to barter for. His wife and female relatives had stamped out several
sacks of paddy for their friend. His sons and other male relatives had
cleaned the Bisáya's boat and supplied him with rattan. In a word, the
whole family had made menials of themselves to satisfy the Bisáya's
every desire.</p>

<p>At the stated time the Manóbo started downstream with the various
commodities that had been requested of him, paddy, tobacco, and other
things. At his friend's house he was received with a great exhibition of
joy and welcome. During his stay he was kept happy by constant doses of
<i>vino</i>. Besides the killing of a suckling pig and of a few
chickens, a little wheedling and palavering were about the only
entertainment he received. But as the grog kept him in good humor and it
is supposed to cost one peso per liter, he was perfectly happy, turned
over his wares to the host, had his accounts balanced for him (he was
usually in a hilarious condition while this was being done), received
further advances of merchandise at the usual usurious rates, and left
for his upland home to tell his family and relatives of the glorious
time he had at his <i>puának's</i>.</p>

<a name="3L315"></a>
<p><i>Bartering transactions</i>.--The following schedule of approximate
values of commodities in the Agúsan, 1905 to 1909, will serve to show
the commercial depredations committed on Manóbos and <i>conquistas</i>
by the Bisáyas who have ever looked upon them as their legitimate
prey.</p>

<a name="T1"></a>
<img src="IMAGES/TABLE01.JPG" alt="Table 1">

<p>To this list might be appended the values of exchange in paddy,
beeswax, and rattan and the corresponding gain made when these latter
are bartered in their turn for hemp or disposed of to the Chinese
merchants.</p>

<p>From the above list it is evident that a Bisáya trader could go up
the river with goods valued at 26 pesos and within a few weeks return
with <i>abaká</i> valued at 138 pesos to 175 pesos, according to the
scales and other measures used. His total expenses, including his own
subsistence, probably would not exceed 30 pesos.</p>

<p>No mention is here made of such luxuries as shoes, hats, or European
clothes on which gains of from 500 to 1,000 per cent are the rule.
Neither have various other usuries been included, such as high interest
or payment of expenses in case of delays, all of which go to swell the
gain that a Bisáya considers his right and his privilege when he has to
deal with beings whom he hardly classes as men.</p>

<p>Among the Manóbos the credit system almost invariably prevails, based
upon the sacredness with which the Manóbo pays his debts. It is true
that the Christianized Manóbo occasionally is not very scrupulous in
this respect, but this is because he has been fleeced so much by his
Christian brethren.</p>

<p>Arriving in a settlement, the trader displays only a part of his
wares at a time. If he has two pieces of cloth, he displays only one. Of
five sacks of rice, only two are his, he claims. In answering the
inquiry as to whether he has dried fish, he says that he has just a
little for his personal use, for the price of it in Butuán was
prohibitive. On being besought to sell a little, he secretly orders it
taken out from the jar and delivered to his customer, at an outrageous
price. The object of this simulation is to hasten the sales of his
wares, for should he display all his stock, many of his customers might
prefer to wait in hopes of a reduction in prices, a sort of a diminutive
&#34;clearance sale.&#34;</p>

<p>As the article for which the exchange is made is nearly always
<i>abaká</i> fiber, it is evident that a certain period, longer or
shorter according to the amount of fiber contracted for, must be allowed
the customer. When this period exceeds a week, the stipulation is made
that the payment shall be made in installments. A shorter period is
allowed than is necessary for the stripping of the hemp, under the
pretense that the trader is in a hurry to leave the settlement and catch
a certain steamer with which he deals. This is a prudent precaution as
the Manóbo is not very methodical in his affairs nor quick in his
movements. A thousand and one things--omens, sickness, bad weather--may
delay him in the fulfillment of his contract. It is this tardiness that
gives rise to the ill feeling and bickering that are not infrequently
the outcome of this system of trading. The Manóbo, moreover, has long
since become aware of the stupendous gain made by the traders, and, when
not dealt with gently, becomes exasperated and on occasions deliberately
delays his creditor. Then again, some other trader may have got into the
settlement in the meantime and seduced him into buying, cash down, some
more enticing article, for this primitive man, like the rest of the
world, often buys what he lays his eyes upon without any thought of the
future. For this reason, the trader keeps close observation upon all who
owe him, almost daily visiting their houses and profiting by the
occasion to help himself to whatever little fish or meat or other
edibles he may find therein. One who has been in debt a long time is a
favorite victim, for when he is unable to pay his debt on time he is
shamelessly required to offer a substantial apology<sup>6</sup> in the
form of a chicken or some other edible.</p>

<h5>GENERAL CONDITIONS OF TRADING</h5>
</center>

<p>In general, there was no established system in the Agúsan Valley as
far as the dealings of Bisáyas went. The constant fluctuation of prices
was a sufficient explanation of this. Thus, rice might be worth 13
centavos per kilogram in Butuán, while at the same time it might command
a price of 43 centavos on the Híbung River or in Veruéla. Salted fish
might be selling in Butuán for a trifle, whereas up the Simúlau a jar of
it at retail might be worth 20 or 30 sacks of paddy. In general the
increase in price of a commodity was in direct proportion to its
distance from points of distribution. By points of distribution are
meant the Chinese stores in Butuán and Talakógon.</p>

<p>Again the old-time custom of selling paddy at a fixed customary price
held the Manóbo in commercial servitude to his Bisáya compeer. This was
due to the intense conservatism of the Manóbo and to his peculiar
religious tenets in this regard, both of which were fostered and
sustained by the tribal priests and encouraged by Bisáyas. Could he have
been induced to retain his paddy instead of selling it at 50 centavos
per sack he would not have been obliged to repurchase at P5 per sack.
The same might be said of his tobacco, which he sold wholesale by the
bamboo joint at 25 centavos each, or, at most, at a peso each, and which
he repurchased, paying, in times of scarcity, 20 centavos for enough to
chew a few times.</p>

<p>The credit system, too, was an impediment to his financial advance.
It seems to have been a tribal institution. During my trading tour I
frequently heard my Manóbo debtors proclaim boastingly to their fellow
tribesmen that I had much confidence in their integrity.</p>

<p>The Manóbo who could gain the confidence of the traders and
accumulate his debts seemed to be an honored person, but when he was
able to make sufficient payment to satisfy his creditors he was a great
man. Hence, the traders played upon his vanity and advanced him such
commodities as he desired, seldom obliging him to settle in full his
obligations, and induced him to accept on credit a certain amount so as
to retain him in bondage to them. It must not be imagined that there was
anything tyrannical in the manner of collecting outstanding debts. On
the contrary, it was almost always done in a gentle diplomatic way, the
trader knowing full well that the Manóbo regarded a debt as sacred and
that he would finally pay it. But it must not be supposed that the
transactions were entirely free from disputes and quarrels. It happened
occasionally that the Manóbo detected the frauds in his creditor's
accounting or remembered omissions of his own in a past reckoning, and
so the bickering began, the Bisáya never caring to admit his errors or
frauds, while the Manóbo, who is a hard and fast bargainer, insisted on
claiming what he considered his rights. As a rule, the matter was
settled peaceably by the principal men of the region. Numerous
instances, however, occurred wherein the Manóbo, exasperated by the
numerous frauds of his creditor, awaited a favorable occasion to
dispatch him. On the whole, it may be said that differences which arose
between Bisáyas and their mountain compeers in eastern Mindanáo are to
be attributed in no small degree to the ruinous, relentless exploitation
of the unsophisticated, untutored Manóbo by the greedy Bisáya
traffickers.</p>

<center>
<a name="3L4"></a>
<h4>INTERNAL COMMERCIAL RELATIONS</h4>
</center>

<p>By internal trading is meant those simple transactions that take
place between Manóbo and Manóbo. The subject presents a striking
contrast to the merciless system adopted by the Christian traders in
their dealings with their pagan congeners.</p>

<p>The transactions are simple exchanges of the absolute necessities of
life.</p>

<center>
<a name="3L41"></a>
<h5>MONEY AND SUBSTITUTES FOR IT</h5>
</center>

<p>There is little conception of money as such among the hillmen unless
they have been in contact with Christian or Christianized traders, and
even then although monetary terms are made use of, there is but a vague
conception of the real value of what they represent. I asked a Manóbo of
the upper Wá-wa the price of his little bamboo lime tube. The answer was
30 pesos.</p>

<p>Money, therefore, has no value as a circulating medium, although it
may be prized as a material out of which to make rings and other
ornamental objects. As substitutes, there are several units of more or
less indefinite value. Thus, the value of a slave which, expressed in
monetary value, varies between 15 and 30 pesos, is mentioned in
connection with large fines and with marriage payments. Again, plates of
the type called <i>píñggan</i> are referred to in small fines and in
other payments, but as these are imported articles the price varies. On
the whole, however, 100 <i>píñggan</i> are worth a good serviceable
slave--that is, 30 pesos. Pigs also are mentioned as a unit of value,
but here again the value is not wholly definite, as a great many of them
are imported and vary with the purchasing price.</p>

<center>
<a name="3L42"></a>
<h5>PREVAILING MANÓBO PRICES</h5>
</center>

<p>The following list will give a fair idea of the monetary value of
some of the commodities that are most frequently exchanged between
Manobos.</p>

<a name="T2"></a>
<img src="IMAGES/TABLE02.jpg" alt="Table 2">

<br>
<br>
<p>The values above indicated are based on the monetary terms used to
represent their value, and borrowed, possibly, from the terms which are
still in vogue in eastern Mindanáo.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>I-sá-ka sá-pi</i> (Bis., <i>ú-sa'-ka sa-lá-pi</i>),
P0.50; <i>ka-há-ti</i>, P0.25; <i>Si-ká-pat</i>, P0.125;
<i>Si-kau-au</i>, P0.0625.</p>

<p>From the above scale it will be seen that a pig 1 year old could be
exchanged for 2 full-grown chickens, 2 sacks of paddy, and 2 bamboo
joints of tobacco. It is not customary to trade in such things as
<i>camotes</i>, taro, and corn, the return of them being the usual
stipulation, but the corresponding values have been inserted in the
above list in order to give the reader an idea of the value of food
commodities.</p>

<center>
<a name="3L43"></a>
<h5>WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</h5>
</center>

<p>No measure of weight is used by the hill Manóbo. The Christianized
Manóbo may have obtained some old scales of the type used by Bisáyas for
weighing <i>abaká</i> fiber. These scales are steelyards, the
construction of which permitted the Bisáya trader to fleece his
non-Christian customers of as much as 50 per cent of their <i>abaká</i>
fiber. The method of falsifying the balance was by loading the
counterpoising weight with lead, and by filing the crosspiece that acts
as fulcrum. Another method which might be used with even true steelyards
consisted in giving the counterpoise arm a downward tilt, after the
<i>abaká</i> fiber had been loaded on the other arm. This was usually
done on the pretense of picking up the counterpoising weight which had
been purposely left on the ground.</p>

<p>In measures of volume the Manóbo is almost equally destitute for he
has only the <i>gántañg</i>. This is a cylindrical measure made out of
the trunk of a palm tree, with a bottom of some other wood. It has a
capacity of from 10 to 15 liters, but I know of no rule which fixes its
exact size. An interesting point with regard to the size of this measure
is that it is double that of the one used by Bisáyas.<sup>8</sup> It is
suggested that the early Bisáya traders, on the introduction of the
Spanish <i>ganta</i> and <i>fanega</i>, taught, for obvious purposes,
their unsuspecting mountain friends to make a measure double the size of
the legal one.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>The <i>gántang</i> measure in eastern Mindanáo is of two
kinds, <i>de almacen</i>, &#34;of the store,&#34; and <i>de
provincia</i>, &#34;of the province.&#34; The latter is twice the size
of the former, and is universally used by the mountain peoples.</p>

<p>In the manner of measuring out paddy (for it is practically only for
this purpose that the <i>gántang</i> serves) there is a feature that is
characteristic of Manobo frugality and economy. The paddy is scooped
with the hands, little by little, into the measure, which is not moved
until it is full. Then with a piece of stick the surface of the paddy is
leveled off and it is emptied into the larger receptacle. At the same
time the number is counted out loudly. The intention in not moving or
disturbing the measure is to allow the paddy to have greater bulk, for
if it is disturbed the grains settle and it requires more to fill the
measure.</p>

<p>Twenty-five of these <i>gántang</i> make a <i>kabán</i>,
<i>bákkid</i>, or <i>anéga</i>, as it is variously called. This
<i>kabán</i>, although there is no measure corresponding to it in
Manóboland, would be equivalent in bulk to two sacks of rice, or about
150 liters.</p>

<p>The yard is the distance from the end of the thumb, when the arm is
extended horizontally, to the middle of the sternum. It, of course,
varies somewhat with each individual.</p>

<p>The Bisáya trader, in measuring cloth, considerably shortens his yard
by not giving a full stretch to the arm, and by slightly turning the
outstretched hand toward his body. This gain, together with another
little one secured when he bites off the measured piece from the bolt,
makes a total gain of 10 centimeters approximately. Remonstrances on the
part of the customer are unavailing, for he is told that such is the
length of the trader's yard and, if the customer is not satisfied, he is
not obliged to accept the cloth. As it is a credit transaction, the poor
Manóbo is obliged to yield.</p>

<p>The fathom<sup>9</sup> is the distance between the thumb tips when
the arms and hands are outstretched. The fraud practiced by the Bisáya
trader in the yard measure is also employed in this.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup><i>Dú-pa'</i>.</p>

<p>The span <sup>10</sup> is the stretch between the tip of the first
finger and that of the thumb as they are stretched over the object to be
measured.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup><i>Dáng-au</i>.</p>

<p>The finger length<sup>11</sup> is the length of either the first or
of the middle finger, according to the custom of each locality.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup><i>Túd-lo</i>.</p>

<p>The joint length <sup>12</sup> is the length of the middle joint of
the finger. It is a measure that is very seldom used.</p>

<h4>SLAVE TRADE AND SLAVES</h4>

<a name="3L51"></a>
<h5>SLAVE TRADE</h5>
</center>

<p>I have not visited the Agúsan Valley since 1910, so that I am unable
to give any information as to the actual extent of slave trading at the
present day. From 1905 to 1909 the practice was in vogue, but to no
great extent. It is reported on all sides by Mañgguáñgans, Mandáyas,
Manóbos, and Banuáons that since the American occupation it has
diminished to a remarkable degree, due to the wonderful reputation of
the Americans for having overcome the Spaniards. This diminution was a
natural sequence of the decrease of war raids.</p>

<p>Slave trading among the Manóbos of eastern Mindanáo was practically
confined to the Ihawán, Baóbo, upper Simúlau, and Agúsan Rivers. I am of
the opinion that during my four years' residence in the Agúsan there
were not more than 100 cases of slave trade in the regions outside of
the Ihawán and Baóbo River Valleys.</p>

<p>The customary value of a slave has been mentioned in this chapter,
but it is only proper to add that a great many considerations, such as
poor health, weak constitution, and other defects which might lessen the
ability of the slave to work, detract from his value. It may be said in
general that the value of a slave ranges between 10 and 30 pesos, never
exceeding the last figure, at which he stands on a par with an unusually
good hunting dog, or with an extra large prolific sow.</p>

<p>Slave trading does not, in the Manóbo's mind, involve the idea of
degradation which attaches to it among other nations. A slave is to the
Manóbo a chattel which he can sell, kill, or dispose of in any other way
that he may deem expedient.</p>

<center>
<a name="3L52"></a>
<h5>CLASSES OF SLAVES</h5>
</center>

<p>Captives<sup>13</sup> are those who have been captured from the
enemy. At first their treatment may be a little harsh, or they may, when
their owners happen to be angry, be killed outright. This is due to the
fact that the feelings of revenge have not cooled off. But after a few
days their condition and treatment is similar to that of ordinary
slaves, except that more precautions are taken to prevent their escape.
If fear of their escape is entertained, it is usual to sell them as soon
as possible.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Bi-ha</i>.</p>

<p>By ordinary slaves<sup>14</sup> are meant those who have been
purchased or who have been delivered over in payment of fines or
marriages. There is no institution in Manóboland by which a freeman, not
a minor, can become a slave by reason of debt. But minors, usually
relatives of the debtor, sometimes in an exigency are turned over in
payment of a debt. This is usually done with a view to avoiding
bloodshed.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup><i>Áñg-lañg</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="3L53"></a>
<h5>DELIVERY AND TREATMENT OF SLAVES</h5>
</center>

<p>The manner of delivering the slave to a new owner depends ordinarily
upon the feelings with which he regards the change, except in the case
of children, who are easily coaxed into accepting it. In the case of
older persons who have been attached to their owners, the matter is more
difficult, as they display a reluctance to change hands. A ruse is then
resorted to, as in a case which I witnessed. The person, in this case a
slave girl, was sent to her purchaser's house, ostensibly for the
purpose of procuring salt and of delivering a basket of paddy. As she
was about to return her purchaser called her back into the house. She
then, realizing the circumstances, burst into tears, but was soon
soothed by the wives of her new owner.</p>

<p>On the whole slaves are not mistreated. Like all menials, they at
times become remiss in the performance of what is expected of them, and
accordingly are given a few blows with a stick or other convenient
object. In a very passionate moment, or when drunk, the master may cut
off his slave girl's hair or denude her completely in the presence of
the household, but such acts are of very rare occurrence.</p>

<p>Immediately after being captured, or after a change of master, the
slave feels his lot keenly, but as time goes on and as he realizes that
there is no hope of deliverance, the remembrance of his relatives fades
away and he resigns himself to his fate. Sometimes one finds a slave who
has become so attached to his master that he is unwilling to return to
his relatives. This is true of those who have been captured when young,
and especially of girls. A fondness often grows up between the latter
and their master's wife, and separation causes loud and long weeping.</p>

<p>A slave enjoys no rights, either personal or political. He can be
disposed of without his consent either by sale or in marriage, or in any
other way his master sees fit. If he runs away he is pursued and brought
back to his master's house. If he runs away with frequency, and the
owner is unable to dispose of him to some one else, he is simply speared
to death. I never witnessed the actual killing, but trustworthy accounts
authenticate the fact that formerly, at least, it occasionally took
place. If a slave flees from his master's house no one may aid or abet
him in his flight, though it is lawful for anyone to capture him with
the intention of returning him to his master, who in this case must pay
the capturer P15.<sup>15</sup></p>

<p><sup>15</sup>On my last trip among the Mandáyas of southeastern
Mindanáo (Karága River) I was instrumental in saving the life of a woman
slave who had escaped six times. At the time of her escape six slaves,
led by a boy slave of about 14 years of age, had fled from the house of
their master. They were recaptured and no punishment except a good
scolding and an infinity of threats was meted out to them. A few days
afterwards an elderly slave again escaped. She was discovered in a
neighboring house and brought back by the wife and daughter of her
owner. When her master saw her he rushed from his house with spear and
bolo and would have killed her had it not been for my remonstrances and
entreaties.</p>

<p>The slave does his share of domestic service. To the female falls the
task of drawing water, gathering firewood, pounding rice, cooking, and
weeding; to the male that of acting as his master's companion, porter,
and general messenger, and of planting <i>camotes</i> and other
crops.</p>

<p>The slave's dress is usually sufficient to cover his nakedness and no
more. Ear disks, bracelets, and similar articles of feminity[sic] are
not allowed, and too neat arrangement of the hair is not countenanced,
as it might be indicative of matrimonial inclinations. Marriage of his
slaves is not looked upon with favor by the master, and he does not
permit it unless the material advantages are so great that they will
repay him for the loss of the slave's services.</p>

<p>I know of few slave marriages. Captives, however, are said to be
married off for a good payment, when their looks and other good
qualities have won the heart of some young man.</p>

<p>My observation and the testimony of Manóboland as to the sexual
morality of slaves is that it is excellent, though no vigilance seems to
be exercised over them in the matter. The female slave makes trips alone
to the water place even by night, and spends many hours of the day in
solitary places while working in the clearings or traveling to the
granary. This sexual morality is due to the fact that intercourse with a
female slave is looked down upon with unmitigated contempt.</p>

<p>The slave fares no worse in the matter of food than the inmates of
the house; possibly he fares even better, for he gets more secret tastes
of sugarcane and roasted <i>camotes</i> between meal hours; during meals
he does not forget himself, as he often has the handling of the pots.</p>

<h2>PART IV. RELIGION</h2>

<a name="4M"></a>
<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>
<h3>GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MANÓBO RELIGION AND NATURE AND CLASSIFICATION
OF MANÓBO DEITIES</h3>

<a name="4M1"></a>
<h4>INTRODUCTORY</h4>
</center>

<p>The matter of Manóbo religious belief is so difficult of
investigation, and withal so important, that I feel a certain amount of
timidity in taking up the subject. The natural suspiciousness of the
Manóbo and his inclination not to answer questions truthfully until he
has assured himself of his interrogator's motives in asking it are the
principal sources of this difficulty. Then again his fear of offending
the divinities, coupled with his absolute subjection in spiritual
affairs to his priests, do not render the undertaking easier. And
finally his primitive, untutored mind is not capable of setting forth in
a satisfactory manner the intricacies, and not infrequently, the
numerous variations and apparent contradictions that arise at every step
in the investigation. However, my sojourn among, and intimate dealings
with, both laymen and priests give me hope that the following is in its
essentials a true interpretation of this primitive religion.</p>

<center>
<a name="4M2"></a>
<h4>GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION</h4>

<a name="4M21"></a>
<h5>SINCERITY OF BELIEF</h5>
</center>

<p>The life of a Manóbo is as deep an expression of his religious
beliefs as that of any man I know. Belief in the supernatural seems to
be instinctive with him. He undertakes no action out of the ordinary
routine without consulting the powers above, and when he has assured
himself of their disapprobation, he refrains most sacredly from his
intended project, even if it should be one so cherished as vengeance on
an enemy. But if these higher powers manifest their approbation he
carries out his project with full assurance of success.</p>

<p>To the Manóbo his deities and demons, spirits, giants, ghouls, and
goblins are as real as his own existence, and his belief in them seems
to him entirely rational and well founded, because for authority he has
tradition and revelation--tradition handed down from generation to
generation, revelation imparted to priests while manifesting all the
indications of what he considers supernatural influence.</p>

<center>
<a name="4M22"></a>
<h5>BASIS OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF</h5>
</center>

<p>I have had occasion to study the working of the Manóbo mind when
brought into contact with phenomena which it had never contemplated
before and I observed that when the phenomenon impressed him as being
not prejudicial nor unintelligible it was ascribed to a beneficent
supernatural agency, but when it produced the impression of being
unintelligible or detrimental it was at once condemned as being the work
of evil spirits. On one occasion a Manóbo of the upper Agúsan
accompanied me to Talakógon and, upon seeing the government launch, made
inquiries as to its nature. His questions being answered to his
satisfaction, he made his comments, praised its form, and finally
declared it to be the work of a god. But when it began to move, giving
forth its shrill whistle and producing the noise characteristic of a
gasoline launch, he at once condemned it as being the work of evil
agency.</p>

<p>I saw another instance illustrative of this tendency upon the arrival
of the first phonograph in the Simúlau River district. My companion was
a Manóbo of the upper Bahaían. Upon hearing the strains of the
phonograph he concluded at once that there was an evil spirit within it.
Notwithstanding the fact that I assured him to the contrary, he
persisted in his belief, averring that no good spirit would give vent to
such an unearthly noise.</p>

<p>Almost invariably my watch, cornet, compass, and barometer were
condemned as being the work of malevolent spirits. Instances might be
multiplied indefinitely, but the general conclusion is that anything
that suggests the unintelligible, the unusual, the suspected, the
gloomy, is at once attributed to inimical powers. Hence a crow that caws
at night is thought to be an evil spirit. The crashing of a falling tree
in the forest is the struggle of mighty giants. The rumbling of thunder,
the flash of lightning, the tempest's blast, and all the other phenomena
of nature are the operations of unseen agencies. The darkness is peopled
with hosts of spirits. On the desolate rocks, in the untrodden jungle,
on the dark mountain tops, in gloomy caves, by mad torrents, in deep
pools, dwell invisible powers whose enmity he must avoid or whose good
will he must court, or whose anger he must placate.</p>

<p>Fear then seems to be the foundation of the Manóbo's religious
beliefs and observances. Untutored as he is, he fails to understand
occurrences which the average trained mind can easily explain. On one
occasion I was at the headwaters of the Abagá River, a tributary of the
Tágo River. I had to cross the river at a point where a mighty rock
stood in midstream, dividing the river in two. I noticed that each of my
Manóbo carriers deposited a little stone near an aperture in the rock. I
asked them why they had made their tribute to the spirit dweller of the
rock, and I could not convince them that the rock was not placed there
by the spirit, but was a natural result of the action of the water. They
would never, they said, be able to return to the Agúsan unless they
showed their good will to the spirit lord of Abagá.</p>

<center>
<a name="4M23"></a>
<h5>MEANS OF DETECTING SUPERNATURAL EVIL</h5>
</center>

<p>In all the concerns of life the Manóbo must secure immunity from the
ill will of the multitudinous spirits that surround him. But this alone
is not sufficient. He must be able to detect future evil, otherwise how
can he avoid it? His ancestors for long bygone generations, have taught
him how to foresee and avoid evil, for they have learned, often after
bitter experience, the signs of present and approaching evil and the
means of effectively avoiding it. These signs are embodied in a system
of augury, that forms one of the most important parts of Manóbo
religion. Hence, before all important undertakings, and, above all,
whenever there is any suspicion of bodily danger or any apprehension of
supernatural ill will, the omens must be sedulously consulted and the
machinations of evil or of inimical spirits thereby detected.</p>

<center>
<a name="4M24"></a>
<h5>BELIEF IN AN HIERARCHY OF BENEFICENT AND MALIGNANT DEITIES</h5>
</center>

<p>Now it happens that at times these omens can not be observed, so that
it might seem that the Manóbo is left exposed to, and defenseless
against, a host of spirit enemies.<sup>1</sup> However, he knows a means
of defense, for the good old people of yore have handed down the belief
that there is an hierarchy of beneficent divinities called <i>diwáta</i>
that are ever ready to be his champions against the powers of evil. The
old, old, people found this faith justified and experienced the help of
the beneficent gods. Why should not he?</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Búsau</i>.</p>

<p>How then is he to communicate with these invisible champions?
Evidently through those who have been chosen by the deities themselves
for that purpose--the order of priests called Italian. And so, following
out the practice of his forefathers, he has recourse to the priests in
more important concerns in which he can not otherwise ascertain the
schemes of malignant spirits or determine the pleasure of the gods. The
priest, in answer to his call, either by means of divination, or by
ecstatic communion with his tutelary deity, or by appropriate offerings,
learns the means to ward off the impending or suspected evil.</p>

<p>Living in a &#34;land of terror,&#34; as he had up to about 35 years
ago, surrounded on all sides by mortal enemies, and in constant warfare
with them, the Manóbo, like his forebears, felt the necessity of having
recourse to spiritual agents for protection against his enemies and for
assistance in conquering them. Herein is involved another feature of
Manóbo religion--the belief in a multitude of warlike spirits called
<i>tagbúsan</i> with whom communication is held through the mediation of
warrior chiefs called <i>bagáni</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="4M25"></a>
<h5>OTHER TENETS OF MANÓBO FAITH</h5>
</center>

<p>Other points of importance in the religious ideas of the Manóbos are
the belief in a future life and in the existence, immortality, and
duality of the soul.<sup>2</sup> An inordinate fear of the dead and of
all connected with them, a host of religious and of other taboos, and a
belief in the efficacy of charms, talismans, and sympathetic magical
means complete the summary of Manóbo religion. For champions the Manóbo
has the tutelary <i>diuáta</i>; for mediators, the <i>bailán</i>; for
guides, dreams, divination, auguries, and omens; for propitiation,
prayers, invocations, oblations, and sacrifice; for proof of faith,
tradition, revelation, and personal experience.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Not the metaphysical soul that is maintained in biblical
and theological belief, but a material counterpart of each
individual.</p>

<center>
<a name="4M26"></a>
<h5>SPIRIT COMPANIONS OF MAN</h5>
</center>

<p>The <i>umágad</i>,<sup>3</sup> or spirit companions of man, as
understood by the Manóbo, may be defined as his material invisible
counterparts without whose presence he would cease to live. He
attributes to these spirits or souls invisibility, power of locomotion,
and to at least one of them immortality. He invests not only men, but
also animals and such plants as are cultivated by man for his
sustenance, with souls or spirits. He will tell you that the soul of
rice is like rice, and exists as a separate invisible form beside the
visible material entity known as rice. I was given to understand that
trees once had souls and in proof of the assertion the narra tree was
cited, for even yet, it was explained, it bleeds when cut.<sup>4</sup>
No other explanation is offered in the case of animals, than that they
live and die and dream, therefore they must have a spirit or soul.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>From <i>á-gad</i>, accompany.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>The sap of the <i>narra</i> tree bears a very striking
resemblance to blood. <i>Narra</i> is one of the <i>Pterocarpus</i>
species.</p>

<p>Vegetable souls in such plants as are used for the nourishment of
man, are explained in the following way: The offerings of rice and drink
which are set out for the deities, tutelary or other, are partaken of
and after repast of the gods the offerings become insipid, because they
have lost their &#34;soul.&#34; I frequently tested the substantial
remains of the spirits' feast and found that they had still retained
their pristine savor and strength. No argument of mine, however, could
convince my Manóbo friends to the contrary. The spirits had consumed the
soul, and there remained, according to their staunch belief, nothing but
the outward form and inert bulk of the former offerings.</p>

<p>The Manóbo supposes himself to have been endowed by Mandáit with two
invisible companions and he is convinced that without their attendance
he could not exist. These souls or spirits are not indwelling principles
of life but are two separate indeterminate entities that differ only in
two respects from the person whose associates they are. The first
difference is that of size, for it is the general belief that they are a
trifle smaller than their bodily associates. Besides being smaller, they
are invisible. No mortal eye, it is said, except the priest's, has seen
a man's spirit companion, and yet it is only for brief intervals that
they are absent from their corporal companions. At times they crouch
upon the shoulders. When the man is making ready for a journey, they do
likewise. When he sets out upon his travels they follow him, one on each
side in somewhat the same way as the &#34;guardian angels&#34; of other
creeds accompany their wards. I once witnessed a little incident
illustrative of this belief. It was on the middle Agúsan, when a mother
was about to leave the house of birth. At the last moment she addressed
the spirits of her little one, conjuring them to follow and to care for
their tender ward.</p>

<p>Hence our souls are as our shadows, our other selves. Notwithstanding
the close association between them and their human companions, they are
seldom invoked. They are considered to have little, if any, power to
help. It is thought that without their presence man would become mad,
and in proof of this I was informed of cases where persons, on being
awakened rudely and hurriedly, had recourse to the bolo, in a fit of
madness due as it was thought, to the absence of their
souls.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p><sup>5</sup>This belief explains the reluctance that the Manóbo, like
members of other Philippine tribes, feels in arousing a person hurriedly
from sleep.</p>

<p>It is said that when we sleep these spirits wander off for a brief
space on their own mystic errands, and their doings are mirrored in our
dreams. Hence the strong and abiding belief of the Manóbo in dreams.
These strange companions of man have no material wants yet they lead an
insecure existence, exposed, as they are, to the insidious attacks of
the common foes of mortals. Hence it comes to pass that one of them,
while away on its random rambles some unlucky day, is mysteriously
kidnaped and finally &#34;devoured&#34; by a ruthless evil
spirit.<sup>6</sup> As soon as the surviving soul realizes what has
taken place, it bemoans the loss of its companion and leaving its
corporal companion unattended wends its way, sad and solitary, to the
land of Ibú. I have been assured by priests that this companionless soul
frequently returns to the scene of sickness and there bemoans with
piteous cries the loss of its companion, heaping horrid imprecations on
the head of the foul spirit that wrought the evil. Only the priest can
hear its wild wail of woe and see its piteous face, all suffused with
tears. Upon seeing the spirit's grief the priest renews at once his
supplications to his tutelary deities, beseeching them to rescue the
captured soul from the clutches of its enemy and thereby save the life
of the patient. Should the prayers of the priest prove unavailing, the
soul wends its way to the region of Ibú, where, free from the
agressions[sic] of earthly enemies, it begins its second and unending
existence in the company of its spirit relatives.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>The &#34;souls&#34; of an ordinary priest and of war
priests, as also those of the slain, are not subject to such attacks,
being under the protection of numerous dieties[sic].</p>

<h4>GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE DEITIES</h4>
</center>

<p>Manóbo religion consists primarily of a belief in an innumerable
number of deities called <i>úmli</i> and of secondary deities called
<i>diuáta</i>. In contradistinction to these is a multitudinous host of
demons known as búsau, waging incessant and ruthless war against the
Manóbo world. In addition to these there is a numerous array of spirits
known as <i>tagbánua</i> to whom is assigned the ownership of the
forests, hills, and valleys, while the various other divisions and
operations of nature are thought to be under the superintendence of
other preternatural beings, beneficent or otherwise.</p>

<p>The conception which the Manóbo has of the supernatural world is very
much like his idea of the world in which he lives. His gods, like his
warrior chiefs, are great chiefs, no one of whom recognizes the
sovereignty of the other. We find no idea of a supreme being as such.
The priests of one settlement have their own special deities to whom
they and their relatives have recourse, while the priests of another
settlement have another set of deities for their tutelaries, with whom
they intercede, either for themselves or for such of their friends as
may need assistance. It is true that each priest has amongst his
familiars a major divinity from whom he may have experienced more help,
but in the spirit world there does not exist, according to Manóbo
belief, one supreme universal being.<sup>7</sup> Each priest declares
the supremacy of his major deity over those of other priests, and
Manóbos declare Manóbo deities to be superior to those of other
tribes.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>During the great religious movement that was at its
height in 1909, there was a general belief in the existence of a
<i>Magbabáya</i>, or supreme being, that was to overthrow the world, but
before my departure from the Agúsan in 1910, this supreme being was
multiplied and was being sold to anyone of Manóbo belief who could
afford to pay the equivalent of a human life. Thus one frequently heard
that So-and-So had received one or more <i>Magbabáya</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="4M5"></a>
<h4>NATURE OF THE VARIOUS DIVINITIES IN DETAIL</h4>

<a name="4M51"></a>
<h5>THE PRIMARY DEITIES<sup>12</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>12</sup>Called also <i>úm-li</i> or <i>ma-di-góon-an no
di-u-á-ta</i>.</p>

<p>The primary <i>diuáta</i> are a class of supernatural beings that
dwell in the upper heavens. It is generally believed that at one time
they led a human existence in Manóboland but finally built themselves a
stone structure up into the sky and became transformed into divinities
of the first order. They stand aloft in a category by themselves and
have no dealings with the Manóbo world. On occasions the minor
<i>diuáta</i> or those of the second class, when they are unable to
afford man the required help, have recourse to these greater deities.
During my last trip to the Agúsan Valley, it was the common report that
the <i>diuáta</i> of a certain Manóbo clan on the upper Umaíam River,
having been unable to protect the people from military persecution had
recourse to this higher hierarchy and that it was only a matter of time
when the members of the clan would be taken up into the higher-sky
regions where the supreme powers dwell and where they would themselves
become <i>úmli</i> or <i>madigónan no diuáta</i>.</p>

<p>It is thought that these deities have brass intestines and that they
can draw up a house into their ethereal abodes with a gold
<i>limbá</i>,<sup>13</sup> but the conception of them is so vague and so
varying that I am unable to give further definite information.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Lim-bá</i> possibly means chain.</p>

<center>
<a name="4M52"></a>
<h5>THE SECONDARY ORDER OF DEITIES</h5>
</center>

<p>It is with the secondary order of divinities, however, that we have
to deal more at length, for they are the guardians and champions of the
Manóbo in all the vicissitudes and concerns of life.</p>

<p>They are thought to be beings that in the long forgotten past lived
their earthly lives here below and after their mortal course was run
were in some inexplicable way changed into <i>diuáta</i>. Though
belonging now to a different and more powerful order, they still retain
a fondness for the tribesmen who sojourn here below. Selecting certain
men and women for their favored friends <sup>14</sup> they keep in touch
with worldly affairs and at the call of their favorites hasten to the
help of humankind.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Lim-bá</i> possibly means chain.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>These are the <i>báilan</i> or priests and priestesses
of Manóboland.</p>

<p>In physical appearance these deities are human and Manóbo-like but
they are described as being &#34;as fair as the moon.&#34; Warriors they
are, to a certainty, for they are said to carry their shield and all the
insignia of a Manóbo warrior chief and to fare forth at times to punish
some bold demon for his evil machinations against the tribe.</p>

<p>They are said to reside on the highest and most inaccessible mountains
<sup>15</sup>in the vicinity of their favorite priests but are ready to
fly &#34;on the wings of the wind&#34; to any part of the world in
answer to a call for help.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>We find several mountains and promontories in eastern
Mindanáo named after these gods, notably Mount Magdiuáta to the
southwest, and the Magdiuáta range to the northwest, of the town of
Liañga. Point Diuáta also, to the west of Butuán, is reported as being
the dwelling place of Manóbo divinities.</p>

<p>On these lofty heights they ordinarily lead a peaceful life. They are
blessed with wives and children and have attendant spirits <sup>16</sup>
to do their bidding. They have slaves, too, in their households, black
ill-visaged demons captured in some great raid. They have few material
wants, for betel nut is said to be their food but still they love to
join in the feasts of mortals and to be regaled with all the good things
of this world. They do not consume mortal offerings in a material way,
for the offerings remain intact except for some slight fingerings that
have been found at times on the surface of the rice and other offerings.
It is only the &#34;soul,&#34; or, as is held by others, the redolence
of the viands that is partaken of. An exception, however, must be made
in the case of the blood of victims, for this is actually consumed by
the deities.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>These retainers are called <i>lim-bó-tung</i>.</p>

<p>So great is their desire for the savory things of life that they are
said to plague their mortal friends into providing them. Thus Mandáit,
the soul spirit, makes the babe restless, and even indisposed, with no
other intention than to induce the people to provide a fatted fowl. It
is believed too that Manaúg, the special patron of the sick, causes many
a bodily ailment in order that his idol may be set up and that he may be
treated to the various delicacies that he is fond of. And the
bloodthirsty war lords, Tagbúsau, must have their blood libation
periodically, whether it comes from a human being or from an animal
victim. It is true that this blood offering is to all appearance taken
by the warrior chief or by the priest, for they ravenously suck it from
the gory wound, or gulp it down from the vessel in which it has been
caught. But it is believed that neither the priest nor the warrior chief
drinks it, but the familiar spirits of the former, or the gods of the
latter, who at the moment of sacrifice have taken possession of them,
and produce in them violent tremblings and other manifestations of
preternatural possession. I could get no satisfactory explanation of the
manner of this possession. It is said to be effected by a mysterious
corporal transformation of the divinity such as even the demons are
capable of when they desire to ply their malice on humankind.</p>

<p>It is during this period of ecstatic seizure that the priest reveals
to the assembled tribesmen the directions and desires of his deities.
Breaking forth with loud voice and great belching into a wild strain, he
announces to the people the recovery of the sick one, or a plentiful
harvest, but it is not the priest that utters these prophecies and
instructions, but the <i>diuáta</i> that speaks through him.</p>

<center>
<a name="4M53"></a>
<h5>THE GODS OF GORE, AND KINDRED SPIRITS</h5>
</center>

<p>These warlike beings are an order of divinities under whose special
protection the priest warrior chief performs his feats of valor, and for
whose special veneration he makes sacrifices and other offerings.</p>

<p>The prevailing idea with regard to them is that they are a class of
deities whose sole delight is the blood of the human race. This is said
to be their choice food, though they are willing, on nearly all
occasions, to accept as a substitute that of a pig or of a fowl.</p>

<p>They are said to dwell in high, rocky places on far-away mountains.
In order to be supplied with the delicacies of which they are so fond,
they select certain individuals for their favorites and servants, and
accord to them an immunity from personal danger.</p>

<p>It is seldom that they leave their rocky dwelling places, but when
they do it is because they consider themselves neglected by their
servants or when they experience an inordinate craving for blood. In
such cases they hasten to plague their favorites in divers ways into
watchfulness and compliance, and thereby keep themselves supplied with
the viands so acceptable to them.</p>

<p>They have messengers, too. These are called <i>pamáiya</i> and are
sent by their masters to human haunts to incite men to anger, and
thereby bring on an occasion for bloodshed, much as the proverbial devil
is said to tempt humankind.</p>

<p>During all ceremonial feasts in their honor they are present and
partake of the blood of the victim, human or animal. And when their
favorite servants go forth to take revenge upon some long-standing
enemy, they accompany him and during the attack are by his side,
protecting him and inciting him to superhuman deeds. And when the enemy,
men and women, lie bleeding all around and the captives have been bound,
these terrible spirits eat, through their favorite's mouth, the heart
and liver and the blood of one of the slain, preferably that of the
chief enemy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>
<h3>MALEFICENT SPIRITS</h3>

<a name="4N1"></a>
<h4>THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF MALIGNANT DEMONS</h4>
</center>

<p>Standing out in strong antithesis to the benevolent divinities is an
order of maleficent spirits corresponding to the proverbial devils of
other cults. Throughout this paper they will be called, for want of a
better name, búsau or demons; that is, evil agents holding an
intermediate place between the higher divinities and men. No uniform
tradition as to the origin of these spirits appears to exist. It is
certain, however, from my investigation that the belief in such spirits
antedates the recent partial Christian conquest of the
Agúsan.<sup>1</sup> It is said that in the old, old days, these spirits
were rather well disposed toward men, and that children used to be
entrusted to their care during the absence of the parents. Be that as it
may, at the present day they have acquired a degree of maleficence that
causes them to be considered the implacable enemies of the human
race.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>The introduction of Catholicism among the pagan tribes of
eastern Mindanáo was begun on a large scale by the Jesuits about the
year 1877.</p>

<p>As frequently described to me by priests and by others who claimed to
have seen them, these foul spirits are human in all other respects
except that they are unusually tall, 2 fathoms being the average height
accorded them. Black and hideous in appearance they are said to stalk
around in the darkness and silence of the night. By day they retire to
dark thickets, somber caves, and the joyless resting places of the
dead.</p>

<p>They have no families nor houses, neither do they experience physical
wants and so they wander around in wanton malice toward men. Seizing an
unwary human &#34;soul,&#34; they make it a prisoner and, sweeping away
with it &#34;on the wings of the wind,&#34; in some mysterious way
devour it. Or, again, simulating the shape of a wild boar, an uncommon
bird, or even a fish, they inflict bodily harm on their human victim.</p>

<p>The story of &#34;Ápo Bóhon&#34;<sup>2</sup> illustrates the belief
in the metamorphosis of these demons. Ápo Bóhon was a Manóbo of the
Kasilaían River. One day, in the olden time, he went forth to hunt but
had no luck, though three times he had offered his tributes to the Lord
of the Agibáwa marshland. Wearied with this hunt, he lay down to rest
toward evening when lo! he spied a monkey and taking his bow and dart
arrow he shot it. But he could not cook it. He piled wood upon the fire
but still the flesh only blackened with soot and would not cook. In his
hunger he ate the flesh raw but he never returned home, for the monkey
was an evil spirit and Ápo Bóhon fell into his power. Thus it is that
until this day he wanders around the woods of Kasilaían and may be heard
toward evening calling his dogs together for his return to his home on
Agibáwa marshland. Woe betide the unlucky mortal who may cross his path,
for now his quest is human. But if, upon hearing his voice, the traveler
calls upon him and offers him a quid, Ápo Bóhon will pass on his way and
do no harm.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>A-po</i> means &#34;grandfather&#34; and <i>bo-on</i>
&#34;ulcer.&#34;</p>

<center>
<a name="4N2"></a>
<h4>METHODS OF FRUSTRATING THEIR EVIL DESIGNS</h4>

<a name="4N21"></a>
<h5>THROUGH PRIESTS</h5>
</center>

<p>Naturally to the priest falls the task of opposing, through his
influence with men's supernal friends, these malicious beings. Having
got together the proper offerings he calls upon his friendly gods, one
or several, and beseeches them to rescue and release the missing spirit
or umagdd, and to punish the offending demons. Well pleased with the
tokens of good will offered by the priest and by his earthly friends,
the friendly deities are said to hasten to their home and gird
themselves for the pursuit. With lance and shield and hempen
coat<sup>3</sup> they start off on the raid. They are described as
having their hair bound up in small wooden hemispheres, their heads
turbaned with the red kerchief, and their necks adorned with a wealth of
charms, much like the great warrior chiefs of Manóboland. Guiding their
footsteps by means of a powerful glass,<sup>4</sup> and traveling with
tremendous speed, they are said to overtake quickly the fleeing enemy,
even though they may have to travel to the other side of the world. Then
begins a fierce battle between them and the enemy for the recovery of a
human soul, or for the purpose of punishing the demons for acts of
malice.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Lim-bo-tung</i>.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>Called <i>espiho</i>. There is a universal belief among
the Manóbos in an <i>espiho</i> (from the Spanish <i>espejo</i>,
looking-glass) by which one can see into the bowels of the earth or to
the extremities of the world.</p>

<p>This battle is described in minutest detail by the priests during the
period of divine possession through which they pass in the course of the
religious ceremonies. At times a hand-to-hand combat between a friendly
deity and some more powerful demon is described at great length. Again
the capture of many evil spirits is the theme of a story.</p>

<p>A common occurrence during these combats is the use of an iron ball
by the friendly deities. The sight of this is said to inspire terror in
the demons and leaves them at the mercy of their opponents. Shut up in
this ball as in an iron prison they are brought back in triumph to the
domains of their conquerors and the rescued companion spirit of man
hurries joyously back to its mortal counterpart. These evil demons are
said to be held as captives in the houses of the good spirits and to
serve them in the capacity of slaves, accompanying and aiding them in
their warlike expeditions against other evil spirits.</p>

<center>
<a name="4N22"></a>
<h5>BY VARIOUS MATERIAL MEANS</h5>
</center>

<p>Besides having recourse to the <i>diuáta</i> the Manóbos make use of
a reed,<sup>5</sup> or vine,<sup>6</sup> of the branches of a wild lemon
tree<sup>7</sup> and other plants,<sup>8</sup> in order to counteract
the evil influence of these fiends. It may be remarked that 11 of these
cause a painful wound on an ordinary human being but that they are said
to be particularly irritating to evil spirits; this is especially true
of the wound made by the <i>sá sá</i> reed. Hence, on occasions when
these demons are expected to be present, the priest secures the
above-mentioned plants and sets them in places where it is thought the
demons may be enticed to enter. It is mostly on the occasion of a death
or of a birth that these precautions have to be taken for the smell of
death and of human blood seems to have a great attraction for these
monsters. On such occasions branches of lemon trees or of the other
plants above mentioned are hung under the house or at any opening in the
wall. The priest, also, frequently carries a sharpened <i>sá sá</i> reed
in the hope of encountering some overbold demon. Although the wound
inflicted by the reed does not kill the demon, yet it is very slow to
heal and is said to be at times incurable.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup><i>Sá-sá</i>.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup><i>U-ág</i>.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>Su-á</i> and <i>Ka-ba-yan-á</i>.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Ka-míli</i> and <i>Húás</i>.</p>

<p>Such is the fear which the evil spirits have of these reeds, vines,
and branches that the mere mention of them is believed to be sufficient
to frighten the demons. Fire and smoke, also, are said to keep them away
and for that reason a fire is often kept burning under the house during
times of sickness and death. Great care is used to keep alive the fire
at night on nearly all occasions of apprehension.</p>

<p>Loud shouts, too, are resorted to in order to intimidate the evil
spirits. During funerals the yelling is particularly noticeable; the loud
yells which one hears while traveling through solitary places in the
mountains and down the rivers are intended as a menace to the malevolent
spirits.</p>

<center>
<a name="4N23"></a>
<h5>BY PROPITIATION</h5>
</center>

<p>When all other means have proved unavailing, propitiation is resorted
to. I witnessed the propitiatory ceremony during several cases of
serious sickness. In each case, when the offerings had been set out for
the benevolent divinities on the regular sacrificial stands,<sup>9</sup>
a corresponding offering of meat, rice, and other things was set out for
the evil demons that were supposed to be responsible for the sickness.
Their offerings were not placed in the house but outside, on a log or on
the ground, and were not touched again, nor eaten by anyone, for the
spirit of evil might have rendered them baneful.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p><sup>9</sup><i>Ban-ká-so</i> and <i>ta-lí-duñg</i>.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>Compare with the customs in vogue in the case of
offerings made to the <i>diuáta</i>.</p>

<p>After the various supplications have been made by the priests to the
good deities, the evil ones are called upon but not in the same way, for
they are not allowed within the precincts of the house, where various
objects, like <i>sá sá</i> and lemon branches, have been placed to
prevent their entrance. They are addressed from the opening around the
house as if they were at a considerable distance, and no very endearing
terms are used. During cases of sickness and especially during epidemics
the custom of making a ceremonial raft is very common. I have heard
numerous accounts both as to the uniformity of this practice and the
reason for it.</p>

<p>Sickness of an unusual kind and especially of a contagious nature is
supposed to be due to the agency of some very powerful epidemic spirits,
who ascend the river, spreading the infection, and eluding at the same
time, the <i>diuáta</i> in pursuit. When the priests decide that all
efforts to secure aid of the good deities are unavailing, they determine
to propitiate the evil epidemic spirits in the following manner: A small
raft of bamboo, 1 meter by 5 meters in the instance I witnessed, is
constructed. On this is securely bound a victim, such as a pig. Fowl
also may be offered on similar occasions and more or less elaborate
ceremonies may be performed, like the blood-unction and the fowl-waving
rite. In the ceremony which I witnessed the demons in question were
formally requested to accept the pig, not to molest the settlement
further, and to take themselves and their pig &#34;down the river.&#34;
The sickness was then addressed and requested to transfer itself to the
body of the pig. After this the raft was freed and in its seaward course
floated into the hands of persons who had less fear of demons than their
Manóbo friends.<sup>11</sup></p>

<p><sup>11</sup>I know that the pig in question was taken and consumed
in a less religious way by a Bisáya trader.</p>

<h4>THE "TAGBÁNUA" OR LOCAL FOREST SPIRITS</h4>

<a name="4N31"></a>
<h5>THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AND METHOD OF LIVING</h5>
</center>

<p>The <i>tagbánua</i><sup>12</sup> or lords of the mountains and the
valleys, are a class of local deities, each one of whom reigns over a
certain district. To them is assigned the ownership of the mountains and
the deep forest and all lonely patches and uncommon places that give an
impression of mystery and solitude.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Tag</i> a prefix denoting ownership, and
<i>bá-n-u-a</i>, &#34;uninhabited place,&#34; the open uninhabited
country as distinguished from the territory in the immediate vicinity of
the main rivers or of settled regions.</p>

<p>The <i>tagbánua</i> are thought to be neither kindly nor unkindly
spirits, and without guile, provided a proper deference is shown them
when we trespass upon their domains.</p>

<p>A <i>tagbánua</i> with his family selects a particular place for his
habitation, sometimes a lonely mountain, sometimes a solitary glade or
some high cliff or gloomy cavern. On one of my trips from Esperanza to
the headwaters of the Tágo River, I saw the dwelling place of a
<i>tagbánua</i>. It was a huge bowlder[sic], called Buhiísan, that stood
at the junction of the two torrents that form the Abagá River, a
tributary of the Tágo.</p>

<p>A favorite haunt of the <i>tagbánua</i> is a natural open place in
the center of the forest. Here he builds a house, or more often makes
his domicile in a balete tree. I have heard it said that he may at times
select the <i>lauán</i> or any other lofty tree but that his choice is
usually the <i>baléte</i>. Here he dwells with his family and is said to
lead a quiet, peaceful life. Day by day he wanders through his realm and
provides himself with the necessaries of life. Uncommon varieties of
plants, such as ferns and ricelike growths, furnish him with the
vegetable part of his meal, while venison and pork are obtained from the
abundance of wild boars and deer. He and his family return home toward
sunset and begin to prepare supper by pounding their rice. Many Manóbos
have heard with their own ears, they assured me, not only the sound of
the rice mortar but all the sounds that are customarily heard in any
Manóbo home.</p>

<center>
<a name="4N32"></a>
<h5>DEFINITE LOCALITIES TENANTED BY FOREST SPIRITS</h5>
</center>

<p>There are in the vicinity of Talakógon two localities where
<i>tagbánua</i> are said to reign. One is called Agibáwa and the other
Kasawáñgan. Both of them are remote timberless places in the center of
swampy regions. In the former the reigning deity had constructed a
house, so I was told by one who claimed to have seen the posts while the
house was still in the process of construction. According to other
reports this deity had a herd of carabaos whose footprints had been seen
by several of my friends and acquaintances.<sup>13</sup></p>

<p><sup>13</sup>These carabaos were evidently the remnant, or the
offspring, of a small herd that escaped to the woods in the time of the
Philippine insurrection.</p>

<p>The Kasawáñgan district was my hunting ground for nearly a year and I
had occasion to observe the character and habits of its deity, as
interpreted to me by Manóbo guides and companions.</p>

<p>It was with the very greatest fear and reluctance that my first guide
introduced me to the marshland. No sooner had I set foot upon it than it
began to rain and my guide requested permission to return. In answer to
an inquiry as to why he wished to leave me he proffered the information
that he was afraid of the <i>tagbánua</i>, who was evidently displeased,
for had not this deity already sent down a shower of rain? The guide
then went on to say that if we persisted in transgressing on the
marshland some greater evil was sure to follow. As I told him that we
would make friends with the diety[sic] he consented to remain with
me.</p>

<p>After all preparations for camping had been completed, my companion
set out an offering of betel nut on a rude stand and addressing the
invisible owner of the marshland, requested him to accept the betel nut
and not to be displeased. My guide offered in his own defense that he
had come into this region unwillingly.</p>

<p>After a few hours' vain endeavors to procure game, my companion made
another donation, requesting the lord of the marsh to forego his ill
will and permit us to get a wild boar. His prayers were unavailing for
no game was forthcoming. When I lost my compass shortly afterwards my
guide assured me that the misfortune was due to the persistent ill will
of the <i>tagbánua</i> toward me.</p>

<p>I continued to visit this region week after week and had considerable
success in getting game, but it was attributed, partly to the fact that
the lord of the marsh had taken a liking to me, and partly to the
offerings of betel nut and eggs made by my Manóbo boys.</p>

<p>Illustrations similar to this of the fear and deference displayed
toward this invisible ruler of solitary places might be multiplied
indefinitely. Suffice it to say, however, that the belief in this class
of spirits is widespread throughout all tribes of eastern Mindanáo,
Bisáyas<sup>14</sup> included.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>Among the Bisáyas who come from Bohol, the respect paid
the <i>tagbánua</i> amounts almost to worship.</p>

<center>
<a name="4N4"></a>
<h4>WORSHIP OF THE FOREST SPIRITS</h4>
</center>

<p>The existence of a <i>tagbánua</i> in any particular locality is
determined by a priest who, through his protecting deities, learns the
name <sup>15</sup> of the spirit, ascertains the cause of his
displeasure on a given occasion, and prescribes the offerings to be made
to him either for reasons of propitiation or of supplication.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>Only the priests may pronounce the name.</p>

<p>Respect must be shown toward the <i>tagbánua</i> in various ways. His
territory must not be trespassed upon, nor any of his property, such as
trees, interfered with unless some little offering is made. His name, if
known, as also the names of fish and of crocodiles, and of other things
which are not indigenous to the region, must in no wise be mentioned. A
violation of this taboo would be followed by a storm or by some other
evil indicative of the <i>tagbánua's</i> displeasure, unless immediate
measures were taken to appease his anger. Again, if one points the
finger at places like a mountain where dwells a <i>tagbánua</i>, the
displeasure of its owner is aroused and the transgressor is liable to
feel the spirit's anger. It was explained to me by several Manóbos that
pointing at the dwelling place of these spirits might result in
petrifaction of the arm.</p>

<p>The occupation of a new site is almost invariably the occasion for an
invocation to the <i>tagbánua</i>, especially if the site be in the
vicinity of a balete tree tenanted by him, for to occupy the place
without obtaining his good will and permission would expose the would-be
occupant to numberless vicissitudes. During hunting and trapping
operations supplication is resorted to, especially when the hunter finds
that game is scarce.<sup>16</sup></p>

<p><sup>16</sup>In the chapter on hunting, the various observances on
such occasions have been described.</p>

<p>In case it is decided by the priest, or even suspected by an
individual that an adversity, such as bad weather or sudden floods, is a
result of a <i>tagbánua's</i> animosity, and that the ordinary simple
offerings are not sufficient to placate him, then a white chicken must
be killed and the regular rites peculiar to a blood sacrifice must be
performed.</p>

<p>It is rare, however, that a Manóbo has so far forgotten himself as to
draw down the resentment of this kindly deity, and render propitiation
necessary. I, however, witnessed a case wherein it was considered
expedient to placate his anger; I was requested to take the necessary
steps, as I was considered the object of his wrath. My Manóbo oarsmen
desired to discontinue the journey at an early hour of the afternoon,
but for several reasons I wished to reach a certain point before
nightfall, so a little ruse was resorted to. I granted their request to
rest and they very promptly went to sleep. Not long afterwards I struck
a few blows on the outriggers with a piece of iron. The Manóbo could
explain it in no other way except that the local <i>tagbánua</i> had
been displeased with my demeanor, for had I not, they said, gone into
the forest in the vicinity of his arboreal dwelling and, notwithstanding
their advice to the contrary, given vent to loud and disrespectful
vociferations. As we were in the vicinity of the <i>baléte</i> tree it
was unanimously decided to push on. At the next few stopping places the
ruse was repeated, so that no doubt was any longer entertained as to the
supposed cause of the occurrence, the wrath of the <i>tagbánua</i>.
Several little incidents, such as striking a hidden snag, and the
increase of the flood, both of which were also attributed to this
spirit's malign influence, heightened their fear. They finally begged me
to stop for the purpose of sacrificing one of my chickens to the
offended deity. We finally reached the desired spot and the supposed
supernatural sounds were heard no longer.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>
<h3>PRIESTS, THEIR PREROGATIVES AND FUNCTIONS</h3>

<a name="4O1"></a>
<h4>THE BAILÁN OR ORDINARY MANÓBO PRIESTS</h4>

<a name="4O11"></a>
<h5>THEIR GENERAL CHARACTER</h5>
</center>

<p>The <i>bailán</i><sup>1</sup> is a man or woman who has become an
object of special predilection to one or more of those supernatural
friendly beings known among the Manóbos as <i>diuáta</i>. This will
explain why the word <i>diuatahán</i> is frequently used, especially by
the mountain people, instead of <i>bailán</i>. I was frequently told by
priests that this special predilection of the deities for them is due to
the fact that they happened to be born at the same time as their divine
protectors. This belief, however, is not general.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Bai-lán</i> is probably a transformation of the Malay
word <i>be-li-an</i>, a medicine man. (Mandáya, Bagóbo, and Subánun,
<i>ba-li-án</i>.)</p>

<p>As a result of the favor in which the supernatural beings hold him,
the priest becomes the favorite and familiar of spirits with whom he can
commune and from whom he can ask favors and protection both for himself
and for his friends. Hence he is regarded by his fellow tribesmen in the
light of a mediator through whom they transact all their business with
the other world. In the hour of danger the <i>bailán</i> is consulted,
and after a brief communion with his spirit Mends he explains the
measures to be adopted, in accordance with the injunctions of his
tutelary deities. Should a <i>baléte</i> tree have to be removed from
the newly selected forest patch, who else could coax its spirit dwellers
not to molest the tiller of the soil, if not the <i>bailán</i>? Should a
tribesman have a monstrous dream and no one of all the dream experts
succeed in giving a satisfactory interpretation, the <i>bailán</i> is
called in to consult the powers above and ascertains that the dream
forebodes, perhaps, an impending sickness and that an offering of a
white fowl must be made to Manáug, the protector of the sick. And should
this offering prove unavailing, he has recourse to his supernal friends
again and discovers that a greater oblation must be made to save the
patient. And if there is a very unfavorable conjunction to omens, who
else but the <i>bailán</i> could learn through his divine friends the
significance thereof and whether the home must be abandoned or the
project relinquished?</p>

<p>At every turn of life, whether the deities have to be invoked,
conciliated, or appeased, the Manóbo calls upon the priest to intercede
for himself, for his relatives, and for his friends.</p>

<p>The office of priest may be said to be hereditary. I found that with
few exceptions it had remained within the immediate circle of the
<i>bailán's</i> relatives. Toward the evening of life the aged priest
selects his successor, recommending his choice to the <i>diuáta</i>. In
one instance that I know of the mother, a <i>bailán</i>, instructed her
daughter in the varieties of herbs which she had found to be acceptable
to her familiars, and I was told that such is the usual procedure when
the priest himself has a personal concern in the succession.</p>

<p>But no matter how proficient the <i>bailán</i>-elect may be in the
sacred rites and legendary songs of the order, he is not recognized by
his fellow tribesmen until he falls into the condition of what is known
as <i>dundan</i>, a state of mental and physical exaltation which is
considered to be an unmistakable proof of the presence and operation of
some supernal power within him. This exaltation manifests itself by a
violent trembling accompanied by loud belching, copious sweating,
foaming at the mouth, protruding of the eyeballs, and in some cases that
I have seen, apparent temporary loss of sight and unconsciousness. These
symptoms are considered to be an infallible sign of divine influence,
and the novice is accordingly recognized as a full-fledged priest ready
to begin his ministrations under the protection of his spiritual
friends. I know of one case on the lower Lamlíñga River, a tributary of
the Kasilaían, where a certain individual<sup>2</sup> became a
<i>bailán</i> without previous premonition and without any aspirations
on his part. He was a person of little guile and one who had never had
any previous training in the practices of his order.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Báya (or Bório) is the young man referred to.</p>

<p>When he receives a familiar deity the new priest becomes endowed with
five more spirits or soul companions, for his greater protection and for
the prolongation of his life. It is evident that his duties as mediator
create a deadly hate on the part of the evil spirits toward him; hence
the need of greater protection, such as is said to be afforded by the
increase in number of spirit companions. It is generally believed that,
due also to this special protection, the priests are more long-lived
than ordinary men. I was informed by some that with the increase of each
familiar there was an addition of five more souls or spirit companions,
but I did not find this to be the common belief.</p>

<center>
<a name="4O12"></a>
<h5>THEIR PREROGATIVES</h5>
</center>

<p>(1) The priest holds converse with his divine friends, whose form he
sees and describes, whose words he hears and interprets, and whose
injunctions, whether made known directly by personal revelation or
through divination or through dreams, he announces. When under supernal
influence he is not a voluntary agent but an inspired being, through
whose mouth the deity announces his will and to whose eyes he appears in
visible incarnation.</p>

<p>(2) By means of his friendship with these unseen beings he is enabled
to discover the presence of the inveterate enemies of human kind, the
<i>búsau</i>, and even to wound them. I investigated two<sup>3</sup>
cases of the latter kind and found that not a shadow of doubt as to the
truth of the killing and as to the reality of this last-mentioned power
was entertained by those who had been in a position to see and hear the
facts.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>San Luis and San Miguel.</p>

<p>(3) As a result of the favor with which he is looked upon by the
beneficent deities, he is enabled to discover the presence of various
spirits in certain localities, and he knows the proper means of dealing
with them. This statement applies to the spirits of
&#34;souls&#34;<sup>4</sup> of the departed whose wishes and wants he
interprets; to the spirits of the hills and the valleys, the
<i>tagbánua</i>, whose favor must be courted and whose displeasure must
not be provoked, and to the whole order of supernatural beings that
people the Manóbo world, with the exception of the blood spirits, the
worship of whom falls to the war priests.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>Um-a-gád</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="4O13"></a>
<h5>SINCERITY OF THE PRIESTS</h5>
</center>

<p>On first becoming acquainted with the <i>bailán</i> system, I was
very dubious, to say the least, of the sincerity and disinterestedness
of these favorites of the gods. But long and careful observation and
frequent dealings with them have thoroughly convinced me of their
sincerity. They affect no austere practices, no chastity, nor any other
observance peculiar to the order of priesthood in other parts of the
world. They claim no high prerogatives of their own; they can not slay
at a distance nor metamorphose themselves into animals of fierce aspect.
They have no cabalistic rites nor magic formulas nor miraculous methods
for producing wondrous effects. In a word, as far as my personal
observation goes, they are not impostors nor conjurers, plying thrifty
trade with their fellow tribesmen, but merely intermediaries, who avail
themselves of their intimacy with powers unseen to solicit aid for
themselves and for their fellows in the hour of trial or tribulation.
&#34;I will call on <i>Si Inimigus</i>&#34; (her <i>diuáta's</i> pet
name, his real name being Si Inámpo), said a priestess of the Kasilaían
River to me once when I consulted her as to the sickness of a child,
&#34;and I will let you know his answer.&#34; On her return she informed
me that the child had fallen under the influence of an evil spirit and
that Si Inimigus required the sacrifice of a pig as a token of my good
will towards him and also as a gratification of a desire that he felt
for such nourishment. She departed as she came, never asking any
compensation for her advice.</p>

<p>I might cite many cases of a similar nature that passed under my
personal observation and in which I made every endeavor to discover
mercenary motives. I frequently interrogated men of political and social
standing as to the possibility of hypocrisy and deceit on the part of
the priests. The invariable answer was that such could not be the case,
as the deities themselves would be the first to resent and punish such
deception. One shrewd Manóbo of the upper Agúsan assured me that the
Manóbos themselves were wise enough to detect attempts at fraud in such
matters.</p>

<p>Moreover, the fact that the priest incurs comparatively heavy
expenses is another evidence of his sincerity, for, in order to keep his
tutelary spirits supplied with the delicacies they desire, he must offer
constant oblations of pig and fowl, since he believes that when these
spirits are hungry they lose their good humor and are liable to permit
some evil spirit to work malice on him or on some of his relatives. Of
course his relatives and friends help to keep them supplied, but at the
same time he probably undergoes more expense himself than any other
individual.</p>

<p>Finally, as further proof of the absence of mercenary motives, it may
be stated that the priest is not entitled to any share of the
sacrificial victim except that which he eats in company with those who
attend the sacrifice and the subsequent consumption of the victim.</p>

<center>
<a name="4O14"></a>
<h5>THEIR INFLUENCE</h5>
</center>

<p>The priest has no political influence as a rule. I am acquainted with
none and have heard of very few priests, who have attained the
chieftainship of a settlement, even among the <i>conquistas</i>, or
Christianized Manóbos, who live within the pale of the established
government. But in matters that pertain to the religious side of life
their influence is paramount, for it is chiefly due to them that tribal
customs and conditions are unflinchingly maintained. The following
incident is an illustration of this influence:</p>

<p>During a visit which I made to the Lamiñga River, a western tributary
of the Kasilaían River, I met Mandahanán, a warrior chief. Among other
matters I referred to the ridiculously low price, 0.50 per sack, at
which Manóbos were wont to sell rice to the Bisáya peddlers who at that
time were swarming in the district. I suggested that they dispose of
their rice at the current Bisáya rate of P2.50 per sack. He replied that
he had been of that opinion for some time, but that the four priests of
his following had decided that an increase of the customary value of
rice would entail a mysterious lessening of the present crop and a
partial or even total loss of that of next year, the reason assigned by
them being that such an action would be displeasing to <i>Hakiádan</i>,
the goddess of rice, and to <i>Tagamáling</i>, the protector of other
crops. These deities, he assured me, were very capricious, and when they
took umbrage at anything, they either caused the rice in the granaries
to diminish mysteriously, or brought about a failure in the following
year's crop.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p><sup>5</sup>The killing of Mr. Ickis, of the Bureau of Science,
according to an account that I received, also demonstrates the influence
exerted by the priests.</p>

<p>To the priests may be ascribed the rigid adherence to tribal
practices and the opposition to modern innovations, even when the change
confessedly would be beneficial to them.</p>

<center>
<a name="4O15"></a>
<h5>THEIR DRESS AND FUNCTIONS</h5>
</center>

<p>The priest has no distinctive dress, but while officiating garbs
himself with all the wealth of beads, bells, and baubles that he may
have acquired. As a rule he has an abundance not only of these but of
charms, talismans, and amulets, all of which are hung from his neck, or
girded around his waist. These charms have various mystic powers for the
protection of his person and some of them are said to have been revealed
to him by his favorite deities. While performing the invocation and the
sacred dance on the occasion of a greater sacrifice, he always carries,
one in each hand, a parted palm frond with the spikes undetached.</p>

<p>All the rites of the Manóbo ritual consist of one or more of the
following elements: Invocation, petition, consultation, propitiation,
and expiation. The priest is, in fact, either alone or aided by others
of his kind, the officiant in nearly every religious ceremony; laymen
merely sit round and take desultory interest in the ceremonial
proceedings.</p>

<p>These rites are the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> (1) The betel-nut offering.<sup>6</sup><br> (2) The burning of
incense.<sup>7</sup><br> (3) Ceremonial omen taking.<sup>8</sup><br> (4)
Prophylactic fowl waving.<sup>9</sup><br> (5) The death feast.<sup>10</sup><br>
(6) The sacrifice of a fowl or of a pig<sup>11</sup> to his own
tutelaries in the event of sickness or in the hour of impending danger.<br>
(7) The offering of a fowl or of a pig to Taphágan, the goddess of grain
during the season of rice culture.<br> (8) The harvest ceremonies in honor
of Hakiádan for the purpose of securing an abundant crop and of
protecting the rice from sundry insidious enemies and dangers.<br> (9) The
birth ceremony in honor of Mandáit for the protection of the recently
born babe.<br> (10) Conciliatory offerings to the demons during epidemics,
as also in cases where the power of the evil spirits is thought to
predominate over that of the kindly deities. Madness and inordinate
sexual passion, as also the continuance of an epidemic after incessant
efforts have failed to secure the aid of the friendly spirits are

<h4>THE BAGÁNI OR PRIESTS OF WAR AND BLOOD</h4>
</center>

<p>The <i>bagáni</i> or warrior priests are under the protection of
preternatural beings called tagbúsau, whose bloodthirsty cravings they
must satisfy.</p>

<p>This peculiar priesthood is not hereditary, but is a pure gift from
warlike spirits, who select certain mortals for favorites, constantly
guard them against the attacks of their enemies, teach them the use of
various secret herbs whereby to render themselves invisible and
invulnerable, bestow upon them an additional number of soul companions
that in some indefinable way protect them against the ire of the
resentful slain, and in general afford them an immunity from all
dangers, material and spiritual.</p>

<p>It is believed that when the warrior priest dies his soul companions
return to the war spirits from whom they proceeded, and with whom they
take up their eternal abode upon the far-off mountain heights. Upon
their return to these heights it is said that they are pursued by a
monstrous crowd of inexorable demons and vexed spirits of those that
have fallen victims to their arm, but that, owing to the power and
vigilance of the mighty gods of war, they reach their last home
unscathed.</p>

<p>Like the priest, a war chief is recognized as a priest when he falls
into that state of paroxysm that is considered to be of preternatural
origin. This condition is usually the result of a wild fight, in which,
after slashing down one or more of the enemy, he eats the heart and
liver of one of the slain and dances around in ungovernable fury. I have
been frequently informed that the companions of a man thus possessed
cautiously withdraw while he is under this influence, as he might do
something rash. I witnessed the actions of several <i>bagáni</i> during
ceremonial performances to the <i>tagbúsau</i>, and I felt no little
fear as to what might be the outcome of the warrior chiefs fury.</p>

<p>What has been said of the sincerity of the ordinary priest and of his
disinterestedness and freedom from mercenary motives applies equally to
the war chief in his position as war priest.</p>

<p>In return for the protection accorded to his select ones the gods of
war require frequent supplies of blood and other delicacies, the denial
of which would render the favorite liable to constant plaguing by his
protectors in their efforts to make him mindful of their needs. In
another chapter we shall see the means whereby the <i>bagáni</i> keeps
himself in the good graces of his inexorable deities.<sup>15</sup></p>

warrior chief as priest the reader is referred to Chapter XXVI.</p>

<h3>CEREMONIAL ACCESSORIES AND RELIGIOUS RITES</h3>

<a name="4P1"></a>
<h4>GENERAL REMARKS</h4>
</center>

<p>The differences which I observed in the performance of ceremonies in
different localities appear to be due to the vagaries and idiosyncrasies
of the individual performers and not to any established system. But in
the main these variations are not essential. For example, in certain
localities the blood of the pig as it issues forth from the lance wound
is sucked from the wound, while in others it is caught in convenient
receptacles and then drank. In the following pages I will attempt to
give a description of the accessories, the sacrifices, and their
associated ceremonies which may be considered general for the Manóbos of
the middle and upper Agúsan.</p>

<a name="4P2"></a>
<h4>THE PARAPHERNALIA OF THE PRIEST</h4>

<a name="4P21"></a>
<h5>THE RELIGIOUS SHED<sup>1</sup> AND THE BAILÁN'S HOUSE</h5>
</center>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Ka-má-lig</i>.</p>

<p>The priest has no special residence nor any special religious
structure except a little wooden shed and a few ceremonial trays that
will be described later. His house is not more capacious nor pretentious
than that of anyone else, in fact it is often less so, but it may be
recognized always by the presence of the drum and gong, by the little
religious shed near by, and by the presence of a few lances, bolos,
daggers, and various other objects that are considered
heritages,<sup>2</sup> handed down from his predecessors in the priestly
office. It is not unusual for the priest, especially among the
Christianized Manóbos, to have two houses, one for the residence of his
family and another which, by its seclusion, is better adapted for the
celebration of religious rites. Hither he may repair, after assisting
perhaps at the Catholic services in the settlement, to perform the pagan
ceremonies that for him have more truth and efficacy than the Christian
rites. While in the settlement and in contact with Christians, he is to
all appearances a Christian, but in the moment of trial or tribulation
he hies him to the seclusion of his other house and, in the presence of
his fellow believers, performs the primitive rites in honor of beings
who, to his mind, are more potent to help or to hurt than the hierarchy
of Catholic belief.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>Án-ka</i>.</p>

<p>In this second house, then, will be found, without fail, not only the
priestly heirlooms, but all such objects as have been
consecrated<sup>3</sup> either by himself or by one of the settlement to
the friendly deities. It may be remarked here that these consecrated
objects can not be disposed of except by performing a sacrifice, or by
making a substitution, usually in the form of pigs and fowl which ipso
facto become consecrated, and are eventually sacrificed to the proper
deity.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Sin-ug-bá-han</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="4P22"></a>
<h5>EQUIPMENT FOR CEREMONIES</h5>
</center>

<p>The altar house is a rude bamboo structure consisting of four posts,
averaging 1.8 meters high, upon which is a roof of palm thatch. About 45
centimeters beneath this are set one or two shelves for the reception of
the oblation bowls and dishes. The whole fabric is decorated with a few
fronds of palm trees,<sup>4</sup> and covers a space of approximately
2.4 square meters.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>The fronds used are one or more of the following palms:
Betel nut, <i>anibung</i>, <i>kagyas</i>, and coconut.</p>

<p>The ceremonial salver<sup>5</sup> is a rectangular wooden tray,
generally of <i>iláñg-iláñg</i> wood, usually decorated with incised,
traced, or carved designs, and having pendants of palm fronds. It is the
ceremonial salver on which are set out the offerings of pig, fowl, rice,
betel nut, and other things for the deities.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup><i>Ban-ká-so</i>.</p>

<p>The sacrificial stand<sup>6</sup> also is made out of
<i>iláñg-iláñg</i> wood. It consists of a disk of wood set upon a leg,
and is used for making the offerings of betel nut and other things.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup><i>Ta-lí-dung</i>.</p>

<p>When it is decided to make an offering of a pig, a sacrificial
table<sup>7</sup> of bamboo is set up close to the house that has been
selected as the place of sacrifice. Upon this is bound the victim, lying
on its side. Over it are arched fronds of betel-nut and other palms.
This stand is used exclusively for the sacrifice of a pig. It is a rude,
unpretentious structure.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>Áñg-ka</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="4P23"></a>
<h5>CEREMONIAL DECORATIONS</h5>
</center>

<p>Fronds of the coconut, betel nut and other palms are the only
decorations used at ceremonies. The betel-nut fronds,
however,<sup>8</sup> enjoy a special preference, being used in every
important ceremony when they are obtainable. No other leaves and no
flowers, unless the bloom of the betel nut be considered such, are used
as decorations.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Known as <i>ba-gaí-bai</i>.</p>

<p>The consecrated objects, consisting of such things as lances, bolos,
daggers, and necklaces, are frequently set out upon a ceremonial
structure or put in the ceremonial shed in order to give more solemnity
to the occasion, and it is not infrequent to find the structure draped
with cloth, preferably red.</p>

<center>
<a name="4P24a"></a>
<h5>SACRED IMAGES<sup>9</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>9</sup><i>Man-á-ug</i>.</p>

<p>Sacred images are of neither varied nor beautiful workmanship. At
best they are but rudimentary suggestions of the human form, frequently
without the lower extremities. Varying in length from 15 to 45
centimeters they are whittled with a bolo out of pieces of <i>báyud</i>
wood, or of any soft white wood when <i>báyud</i> is not obtainable.
More elaborate images are furnished with berries of a certain
tree<sup>10</sup> for eyes and adorned with tracings of sap from the
<i>kayúti</i> or the <i>narra</i> tree, but the ordinary idol has a
smearing of charcoal for eyes and mouth and a few tracings of the same
for body ornamentation.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup><i>Ma-gu-baí</i>.</p>

<p>Images are made in two forms, one representing the male and
distinguished by the length of its headpiece and occasionally by the
representation of the genital organ, the other representing the female,
and distinguished most frequently by the representation of breasts,
though in a good image there is often a fair representation of a
comb.</p>

<p>Images are intended for the same use as statues in other religions.
They are not adored nor worshiped in any sense of the word. They are
looked upon as inanimate representations of a deity, and tributes of
honor and respect are paid not to them, but to the spirits that they
represent. I have seen rice actually put to the lips of these images and
bead necklaces hung about their necks; but in answer to my inquiries the
response was always the same that not the images, but the spirits, were
thereby honored.</p>

<p>It is principally in time of sickness that these images are made.
They are placed somewhere near the patient, generally just under the
thatch of the roof.</p>

<p>The priest almost invariably has one, or a set of better made ones,
which he sets out during the more important ritual celebrations and
before which he places offerings for the spirits represented. In a
sacrifice performed for the recovery of a sick man on the upper Agúsan,
I saw two images, one male and one female, carried in the hand by the
presiding priests and made to dance and perform some other suggestive
movements.</p>

<p>Occasionally one finds very crude effigies of deities carved on a
pole and left standing out on the trail or placed near the house. These
are supposed to serve for a resting place for the deities that are
expected to protect the settlement or the house. This practice is very
common when fear of an attack is entertained, and also during an
epidemic.</p>

<center>
<a name="4P24"></a>
<h5>CEREMONIAL OFFERINGS</h5>
</center>

<p>Offerings consist, in the main, of the blood<sup>11</sup> and meat of
pig and fowl, betel-nut quids, rice, cooked or uncooked, and an
exhilarating beverage. But occasionally a full meal, including every
obtainable condiment, is set out, even an allowance of water, wherewith
to cleanse<sup>12</sup> the hand, being provided for the visiting
deities. Such offerings are set out upon consecrated plates<sup>13</sup>
which are used for no other purpose and can not be disposed of.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>No reference is here made to human blood, a subject
which will be found treated in Chapter XXVI.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Pañg-hú-gas</i>.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>A-pú-gan</i>.</p>

<p>As a rule the offerings must be clean and of good quality. The priest
is very careful in the selection of the rice, and picks out of it all
dirty grains. Cooked rice given in offering is smoothed down, and, after
the deity has concluded his mystic collation is examined for traces of
his fingering.</p>

<p>The color of the victims is a matter of importance, too, for the
divinities have their special tastes. Thus <i>Sugúdan</i>, the god of
hunters, prefers a red fowl, while the <i>tagbánua</i> display a
preference for a white victim.</p>

which such ceremonies belong. Thus the child ceremony is placed under
the heading &#34;birth,&#34; the death feast in the chapter on death,
the warriors' sacrifice in that portion of this sketch which treats of
the warrior. For the present only the minor and more general ceremonies
that may be performed separately, or that may enter into the major
ceremonies as subrites, will be described.</p>

<center>
<a name="4P32"></a>
<h4>METHOD OF PERFORMANCE</h4>
</center>

<a name="4P321"></a>
<p><i>The betel-nut tribute</i>.--In all dealings with the unseen world,
the offering of betel nut is the first and most essential act, just as
it constitutes in the ordinary affairs of Manóbo life the essential
preliminary to all overtures made by one man to another. The ceremony
may be performed by anyone, but partakes of only a semireligious
character when not performed by a <i>bailán</i>.</p>

<p>The ceremony consists in setting out on a consecrated
plate,<sup>26</sup> or in lieu of it on any convenient receptacle, the
ordinary betel-nut quid, consisting of a slice of betel nut placed upon
a portion of <i>buyo</i> leaf, and sprinkled with a little lime. The
priest who has more than one divine protector, must give a tribute to
each one of them. In certain ceremonies seven quids are invariably set
out by him, always accompanied by an invocation, the strain of which is
usually very monotonous and always couched in long periphrastic
preambles. It is really an invitation to the spirit whose aid is to be
implored to partake of the offering.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup><i>A-pú-gan</i>.</p>

<p>Out in the lonely forest the hunter may set his offering upon a log
for the spirit owner of the game, or if in the region of a balete tree,
he may think it prudent to show his deference to its invisible dwellers
by offering them this humble tribute. Again, should a storm overtake him
on his way, and should he dread the &#34;stony tooth&#34; of the
thunder, he lays out his little offering, quite often with the thought
that he has in some unknown way annoyed Anítan, the wielder of the
thunderbolt, and must in this fashion appease the offended deity.</p>

<a name="4P322"></a>
<p><i>The offering of incense</i>.--This ceremony appears to be confined
to priestesses. I have never seen a Manóbo priest offer incense. The
resin<sup>27</sup> of a certain tree is used for the purpose, as its
fragrance is deemed to be especially pleasing to the deities. The
priestess herself, or anyone else at her bidding, removes from the
pod<sup>28</sup> at her side, where it is always carried depending from
the waist, a little of the resin and lights it. It is then set on the
altar or in any convenient spot. The direction of its smoke is thought
to indicate the approach and position of the deity invoked. As the smoke
often ascends in a slanting direction, it frequently directs itself
toward the suspended oblation trays. This is taken as an indication that
the deity is resting or sitting upon the <i>bankáso</i> tray, in which
case he is called <i>bankasúhan</i>, or on the <i>talíduñg</i>, when he
is said to be <i>talidúñgan</i>. This ceremony is preliminary to the
invocation.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup><i>Tú-gak to ma-gu-bái</i>.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup>This is the pod of a tree called <i>ta-bí-ki</i>.</p>

<p>The deities are very partial to sweet fragrances like that of the
betel nut frond and of the incense and seem to be averse to strange or
evil smells. Hence fire and smoke are usually avoided during the
celebration of regular sacrifices, as was stated before. On one occasion
I wished to do a favor by lending my acetylene lamp during a ceremonial
celebration, but it was returned to me with the information that the
smell was not acceptable to the presiding deities.</p>

<a name="4P323"></a>
<p><i>Invocation</i>.--The invocation is a formal address to the
deities, and on special occasions even to the demons, when it is desired
to make a truce with them. It is the prerogative of the priest in nearly
all ceremonies. As a rule it begins in a long, roundabout discourse and
extends itself throughout the whole performance, continuing at intervals
for a whole night or longer in important ceremonies. It may be
participated in by one priest after another, each one addressing himself
to his particular set of divinities and beseeching them by every form of
entreaty to be propitious.</p>

<p>The invocation to the good spirits is made at the discretion of the
officiating priest, either in the house or outside, and in a moderate
voice, but the invocation to the evil ones is shouted out in a loud
voice usually from the opening around the walls of the house, as it is
considered more prudent to keep the demons at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>In addressing his gods the Manóbo proceeds in about the same way as
he does when dealing with his fellow men. He starts well back from the
subject and by a series of circumlocutions slowly advances to the point.
The beginning of the invocation is ordinarily in a laudatory strain; he
reminds his divinities of his past offerings, descants on the size of
the victims offered on previous occasions, and the general expenses of
past sacrifices. He then probably recalls to their minds instances where
these sacrifices had not been reciprocated by the deities. Having thus
intimated to the invisible visitors, for they are thought to be present
during these invocations, that he and his people are somewhat ill
pleased, he goes on to express the hope that in the future and
especially on this occasion they will show themselves more grateful. He
next proceeds to enumerate the expenses which in their honor are about
to be incurred. The fatness and price of the pig are set forth and every
imaginable reason adduced why they should be well pleased with the
offerings and make a bountiful return of good will and friendship. The
spirits may be even bribed with the promise of a future sacrifice, or
they may be threatened with desertion and the cessation of all worship
of them.</p>

<p>After a long prologue the priest makes an offering of something, it
may be a glass of brew, or a plate of rice, and confidentially imparts
to his spirits the object of the ceremony. In this manner the invocation
is continued, interrupted at intervals by the sacred dance or by periods
of ecstatic possession of the priest himself.</p>

<a name="4P324"></a>
<p><i>Prophylactic fowl waving</i>.--The fowl-weaving ceremony may be
performed by one not of the priestly order. The performance is very
simple. A fowl of no special color is taken in one hand and, its legs
and wings being secured to prevent fluttering, it is waved over the
person or persons in whom the evil influence is thought to dwell and at
the same time a short address is made in an undertone to this same
influence,<sup>29</sup> bidding it betake itself to other parts. The
chicken may be then killed ceremonially and eaten, but if it is not
killed it becomes consecrated and is given to the priest until it can be
disposed of in a ceremonial way on a future occasion.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup><i>Ka-dú-ut</i>.</p>

<p>This ceremony is very common, especially after the occurrence of a
very evil dream or a bad conjunction of omens or in case of severe
sickness or on the erection of a new house or granary. On one occasion
it was performed on me under the impression, it is presumed, that I was
the bearer of some malign influence.</p>

<p>I have never been definitely informed as to the reason for the
efficacy of this rite, nor of its origin. Tradition handed down by the
old, old folks and everyday experience are sufficient foundation for the
popular belief in its efficacy.</p>

<a name="4P325"></a>
<p><i>Blood lustration</i>.--When a fowl or a pig has been killed
sacrificially, it is customary to smear the blood on the person or
object from whom it is desired to drive out the sickness, or in order to
avert a threatened or suspected danger, or when it is desired to nullify
an evil influence. The ceremony is performed only by a priest and in the
following way: Taking blood in a receptacle to the person for whose
benefit it is intended, the priest dips his hand in it and draws his
bloody finger over the afflicted part, or on the back of the hand and
along the fingers in the case of a sick person, or on the post of the
house, thereby leaving bloody stripes. During the operation he addresses
the indwelling evil and bids it begone. This ceremony usually follows
the preceding one and is performed in all cases where the previous
ceremony is applicable, if the circumstances are considered urgent
enough to call for its performance.</p>

<p>I once saw a variation of this ceremony. Instead of killing the fowl
the priest made a small wound in one leg and applied the blood that
issued to a sick man. The fowl then became the property of the priest
and could never be eaten, for the evil influence that had produced the
sickness in the man was supposed to have passed into the fowl.</p>

<a name="4P326"></a>
<p><i>Lustration by water</i>.--Lustration by water is somewhat similar
in its purpose to the preceding ceremony. It is performed as a subrite
among the Christianized Manóbos of the lake region. I am inclined to
think that it is only an imitation of an institution of the Catholic
Church because I never saw it performed by non-Christian Manóbos.</p>

<p>The following is the cermony[sic]: When the divinities are thought to
have eaten the soul or redolence<sup>30</sup> of the viands set out for
them, and to have cleansed their hands in the water provided for that
purpose, the priest seizes a small branch, dips it in this water and
sprinkles the assembly. Though, on the occasions on which I witnessed
this rite, the recipients did not seem to relish the aspersion, as was
evinced by their efforts to avoid it, yet it was believed to have great
efficacy in removing ill luck and malign influences.<sup>31</sup></p>

<h3>SACRIFICES AND WAR RITES</h3>

<h4>THE SACRIFICE OF A PIG</h4>
</center>

<p>Religion is so interwoven with the Manóbo's life, as has been
constantly stated in this monograph, that it is impossible to group
under the heading of religion all the various observances and rites that
properly belong to it.<sup>1</sup> I will now give an account of the
sacrifice of a pig that took place on the Kasilaían River, central
Agúsan, for the recovery of a sick man. This sacrifice may be considered
typical of the ordinary ceremony in which a pig is immolated, whether it
be for the recovery of a sick man or to avert evil or to solicit any
other favor.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>The reader is referred to Chapter XV for a description of
the important religious ceremonies and beliefs connected with the
subject of death, to Chapter X for rice culture ceremonies, to Chapter
XIV for the birth ceremony. Descriptions of various other ceremonies
will be found scattered through this monograph, each under its proper
heading.</p>

<p>I arrived at the house at about 4 p.m. Near the pole leading up to
the house stood the newly erected rectangular bamboo stand.<sup>2</sup>
On this, with a few palm fronds arched over it, was tightly bound the
intended victim, a fat castrated pig. Within a few yards of this had
been erected the small houselike structure,<sup>3</sup> which has been
described already. It contained several plates full of offerings of
uncooked rice and eggs, which had been placed there previously. The
ceremonies began shortly after my arrival. Three women of the priestly
order sat down near the ceremonial house and prepared a large number of
betel-nut quids for their respective deities, but the spectators never
ceased for a moment to ask for a share of them. Finally, however, the
quids were prepared and placed on the sacred plates, seven to each
plate. Then one of the priestesses placed a little resin upon a piece of
bamboo and, calling for a firebrand, placed it upon the resin. The other
two priestesses, seizing in each hand a piece of palm branch, proceeded
to dance to the sound of drum and gong. They were soon joined by the
third officiant. All three danced for some five minutes until, as if by
previous understanding, the gong and drum ceased, and one of the
priestesses broke out into the invocation. This consisted of a series of
repetitions and circumlocutions in which her favorite deities were
reminded of the various sacrifices that had been performed in their
honor from time immemorial; of the number of pigs that had been slain;
of the size of these victims; of the amount of drink consumed; of the
number of guests present; and of an infinity of other things that it
would be tedious to recount. This was rattled off while the spectators
were enjoying themselves with betel-nut chewing and while conversation
was being carried on in the usual vehement way. Then the drum and gong
boomed out again and the three priestesses circled about in front of the
ceremonial shed for about five minutes, after which comparative quiet
ensued and another priestess took up the invocation. During her prolix
harangue to the spirits the other two busied themselves, one in
rearranging the offerings in the little shed, the other in lighting more
incense, while the spectators continued their prattle, heedless of the
services. After an interval of some 10 minutes the sacred dance was
continued, the priestesses circling and sweeping around with their palm
branches waving up and down as they swung their arms in graceful
movements through the air. This continued for several minutes, until one
of them stopped suddenly and began to tremble very perceptibly. The
other two continued their dance around her, waving their palm fronds
over her. The trembling increased in violence until her whole body
seemed to be in a convulsion. Her eyes assumed a ghastly stare, her
eyeballs protruded, and the eyelids quivered rapidly. The drum and gong
increased their booming in volume and in rapidity, while the dancers
surged in rapid circles around the possessed one, who at this period was
apparently unconscious of everything. Her eyes were shaded with one hand
and a copious perspiration covered her whole body. When finally the
music and the dancing ceased her trembling still continued, but now the
loud belching could be heard. No words can describe the vehemence of
this prolonged belching, accompanied as it was by violent trembling and
painful gasping. The spectators still continued their loud talking with
never a care for the scene that was being enacted, except when some one
uttered a shrill cry of animation, possibly as menace to lurking
enemies, spiritual or other.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>Añg-kan</i>.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Ka-má-lig</i>.</p>

<p>It was some 10 minutes before the paroxysm ceased, and then the now
conscious priestess broke forth into a long harangue in which she
described what took place during her trance, prophesying the cure of the
sick man, but advising a repetition of the sacrifice at a near date, and
uttering a confusion of other things that sounded more like the ravings
of a madman than the inspirations of a deity. During all this time
frequent potations were administered to the spectators, so that in the
early night everyone was feeling in high spirits.</p>

<p>After the first priestess had emerged fully from the trance the drum
and gong resounded for the continuation of the dance. In turn the other
priestesses fell under the influence of their special divinities and
gave utterance to long accounts of what had passed between them. It was
at a late hour of the night that the whole company retired to the house,
leaving the victim still bound upon his sacrificial table.</p>

<p>The religious part of the celebration was then abandoned, for the
priestesses took no further part. Social amusements, consisting of
various forms of dancing, mimetic and other, were performed for the
benefit of the attendant deities and finally long legendary
chants<sup>4</sup> by a few priests consumed the remainder of the
night.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup><i>Túd-um</i>.</p>

<p>Next morning at about 7 o'clock the ceremonies were resumed by the
customary offering of betel nut and by burning of incense, but instead
of dancing before the small religious house the three priestesses,
joined by a priest, took up their position near the sacrificial table on
which the victim had remained since the preceding day. The invocations
were pronounced in turn, followed by short intervals of dancing. During
these invocations the victim was bound more securely, and a little lime
was placed on its side just over the heart. The priest then placed seven
betel-nut quids upon the body of the pig and made a final invocation. A
rice mortar was placed at the side of the sacrificial table, a relative
of the sick man stepped upon it, and, receiving a lance from the hands
of the male priest, poised it vertically above the spot designated by
the lime and thrust it through the heart of the victim.</p>

<p>One of the female priestesses at once placed an iron cooking pan
under the pig and caught the blood as it streamed out from the lower
opening of the wound. Applying her mouth to the pan she drank some of
the blood and gave the pan to a sister priest.<sup>5</sup> At the same
time a little was given to the sick man, who drank it down with such
eager haste that it ran upon his cheeks. One of the priestesses then
performed blood lustration by anointing the patient's forehead with the
remainder of the blood. A few others, of whom I was one, had these
bloody ministrations performed on them.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>Not infrequently the blood is sucked from the upper
wound. This is a custom more prevalent among the Mandáyas than among the
Manóbos.</p>

<p>The priest and priestesses at this period presented a most strange
spectacle. With faces and hands besmirched with clotted blood, they
stood trembling with indescribable vehemence. Their jingle bells tinkled
in time with the movement of their bodies. The priestesses recovered
from their furious possession after a few minutes, but not so the male
priest, for to prevent himself from collapsing completely he clutched a
near-by tree, shading his eyes with his bloodstained hand. The drum and
gong came into play again and the priestesses took up the step, circling
around their entranced companion and addressing him in terms that on
account of the rattle of the drum and the clanging of the gong could not
be heard. He finally emerged, however, all dazed and covered with
perspiration. Through him a <i>diuáta</i> announced the recovery of the
patient, at which yells of approval rang out, and then began a social
celebration consisting of dancing and drinking. This was continued till
the hour for dinner, when the victim was consumed in the usual way.</p>

<p>In this instance, as in many others witnessed, the sick man
recovered, and with a suddenness that seemed extraordinary. This must be
attributed to the deep and abiding faith that the Manóbo places in his
deities and in his priests. The circumstances of the sacrifice are such
as to inspire him with confidence and, strong in his faith, he recovers
his health and strength in nearly every case.</p>

<h4>RITES PECULIAR TO THE WAR PRIESTS</h4>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p> (1) The betel-nut tribute to the gods of war.<br> (2) The supplication
and invocation of the gods of war.<br> (3) The betel-nut offering to the
souls of the enemies.<br> (4) The various forms of divination.<br> (5) The
ceremonial invocation of the omen bird.<br> (6) The <i>tagbúsau's</i> feast.<br>
(7) Human sacrifice.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first two ceremonies differ from the corresponding functions
performed by the ordinary priests in only two respects, first that they
are performed in honor of the war spirits, and secondly that the
invocation includes an interminable list of the names of those slain by
the officiating warrior chief and by his ancestors for a few generations
back.</p>

<p>The sacred dance for the entertainment of the attending divinities
with which this invocation and supplication is repeatedly interrupted
will be described later on.</p>

<center>
<a name="4Q21"></a>
<h5>THE BETEL-NUT OFFERING TO THE SOULS OF THE ENEMIES</h5>
</center>

<p>The ceremony is performed only before an expedition, with a view to
securing the good will of souls of the enemies who may be slain in the
intended fray. As was set forth before, souls, or departed spirits, seem
to have a grievance against the living, and are wont to plague them in
diverse ways. Now, in order to avoid such ill will as might follow the
separation of these spirits from their corporal companions, a ceremony
is performed by the warrior priest in the following way: He orders an
offering of rice to be set out upon the river bank, or on the trail over
which the spirits are expected to wing their way, and hastens to invite
them to a conference. Then a number of pieces of betel leaf are set out
on a shield, so that each soul or spirit has his portion of betel leaf,
his little slice of betel nut, and his bit of lime. Then the warrior
chief, or some one else at his bidding, addresses the souls without
making it known that an attack<sup>6</sup> is soon to be made. It is
then explained to these spirits that they are invited to partake of the
offering in good will and peace, that the warrior priest's party has a
grievance against their enemies, and that some day they may be obliged
to redress the matter in a bloody way. The souls next are urged to
forego their displeasure, should it become necessary at any time to
redress the wrongs by force and possibly slay the authors of them. The
invisible souls are then supposed to partake of the offering and to
depart in peace as if they understood the whole situation.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>I was informed that a sometime friend or distant relative
of the enemy is generally selected for this task.</p>

<p>There is an incident, which is said to occur during the above
ceremony, that deserves special mention, as it illustrates very
pointedly the spirit in which the ceremony is performed. All arms are
said to be placed upon the ground and carefully covered with the shields
in such a way that the spirit guests will be unable to detect their
presence on their arrival. The betel-nut portions are placed upon one of
the upper shields.</p>

<center>
<a name="4Q22"></a>
<h5>VARIOUS FORMS OF DIVINATION</h5>
</center>

<a name="4Q221"></a>
<p><i>The betel-nut cast</i>.<sup>7</sup>--This form of divination is
never omitted, according to all accounts. In the instance which I
witnessed the procedure was as follows: The leader of the expedition
invoked the <i>tagbúsau</i>, informing him that each of the quids
represented one of the enemy, and beseeching him (or them) to indicate
by the position of these symbols after the ceremony the fate of the
enemy. The warrior priest or his representative, lifting up the shield
with one hand under it, and one hand above it, turned it upside down
with a rapid movement, thus precipitating the quids on the floor. Now
those that fell vertically under the shield represented the number of
the enemy who would fall into their clutches, while those that lay
without the pale of the shield represented the individuals who would
escape, and to whose slaughter accordingly they must devote every
energy. There are numerous little details in this, as in most other
forms of divination, each one of which has an interpretation, subject,
it would appear, to the vagaries of each individual augur.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>Ba-lís-kad to ma-má-on</i>.</p>

<a name="4Q222"></a>
<p><i>Divination from the báguñg vine</i>.--Before leaving the point
from which it has been decided to begin the march two pieces of green
rattan, the length of the middle finger and about 1 centimeter thick,
are laid upon the ground parallel to each other and about 2.5
centimeters apart. One of these stands for the enemy and the other for
the attacking party. A firebrand is then held over the two until the
heat causes one of them to warp and twist to one side or the other. Thus
if the strip that represents the enemy were to begin to twist over
toward that of the aggressors, while that of the latter twists away from
the former, the omen would be bad, for it would denote the flight of the
assaulting party. Should, however, the rattan of the aggressors twist
over and fall on the other, the omen would be auspicious and the march
might be entered upon.</p>

<p>The various twists and curls of these strips of rattan are observed
with the closest attention and interpreted variously. Should the omen
prove ill, the <i>tagbúsau</i> must be invoked and other forms of
divination tried until the party feels assured of success.</p>

<a name="4Q223"></a>
<p><i>Divination from báya squares</i>.--The <i>báya</i> is a species of
small vine, a fathom of which is cut by the leader into pieces exactly
the length of the middle finger. These pieces are then laid on the
ground in squares. Should the number of pieces be sufficient to
constitute complete squares without any remainder the omen is bad in the
extreme, but should a certain number of pieces remain the omen is good.
Thus if one piece remains the attack will be successful and of short
duration. If two remain, the outcome will be the same, but there will be
some delay; and if three remain, the delay will be considerable, as it
will be necessary to construct ladders.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Pa-ga-hag-da-nán</i>.</p>

<p>When any of the omens taken by one of the above forms of divination
prove unpropitious, the tagbúsau must be invoked and other divinatory
methods tried until the party is satisfied that a reasonable amount of
success is assured. But should the omens indicate a failure or a
disaster, the expedition must be put off or a change made in the party.
Thus, for instance, the bad luck<sup>9</sup> might be attributed to the
presence of one or more individuals. In that case these persons are
eliminated and the omens repeated. It is needless to say that the
observance of all the omens necessary for an expedition, together with
the concomitant ceremonies, may occupy as much as three days and
nights.</p>

<h4>INVOCATION OF THE OMEN BIRD<sup>10</sup></h4>
</center>

<p><sup>10</sup><i>Pan-áu-ag-táu-ag to li-mó-kon</i>.</p>

<p>Though at the beginning of ordinary journeys the consultation of the
omen bird is of primary importance, yet before a war expedition it
acquires a solemnity that is not customary on ordinary occasions. This
ceremony is the last of all those that are made preparatory to the
march.</p>

<p>The warrior priest turns toward the trail and addresses the invisible
turtledove, beseeching it to sing out from the proper direction and
thereby declare whether they may proceed or not. In one of the instances
that came under my personal observation a little unhulled rice was
placed upon a log for the regalement of the omen bird, and a tame pet
omen bird in an adjoining house was petted and fed and asked to summon
its wild mates of the encircling forest to sing the song of victory.
Many of the band imitate the turtle bird's cry<sup>11</sup> as a further
inducement to get an answer from the wild omen birds that might be in
the neighborhood.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>This is done by putting the hands crosswise, palm over
palm and thumb beside thumb. The cavity between the palms must be
tightly closed, leaving open a slit between the thumbs. The mouth is
applied to this slit and by blowing in puffs the Manóbo can produce a
sound that is natural enough to elicit in many cases response from a
turtledove that may be within hearing distance. In fact, I have known
the birds to approach within shooting distance of the artificial
sounds.</p>

<center>
<a name="4Q4"></a>
<h4>THE TAGBÚSAU'S FEAST</h4>
</center>

<p>In the ceremonies connected with, the celebration in honor of his war
lord the warrior priest is the principal personage, but he is usually
assisted by several of the chief priests of the ordinary class. Such is
the general account, and such was the procedure in the ceremony that I
witnessed in 1907, of which the following are the main details and which
will serve as a general description of the ceremony:</p>

<p>The appurtenances of the ceremony were identical with those described
before under ceremonial accessories, except that a piece of bamboo,
about 30 centimeters long, parted and carved into the form of a crude
crocodile with a betel-nut frond hanging from it, was suspended in the
diminutive offering house referred to so many times before. Objects of
this kind, like this piece of bamboo, have a mouthlike form and vary
from 30 to 60 centimeters in length. They are, as it were, ceremonial
salvers on which are set the offerings of blood and meat and
<i>gíbañg</i><sup>12</sup> for the war deities.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Gí-bañg</i> is the nape of the neck, and here refers
to that of a pig.</p>

<p>In the ceremony that I am describing I noticed a plate of rice set
out on an upright piece of bamboo, the upper part of which had been
spread out into an inverted cone to hold the plate. The pig had been
bound already to its sacrificial table, but was ceaseless in its cries
and in its efforts to release itself. Several war and ordinary priests,
covered with all their wealth of charms and ornaments, were scattered
throughout the assembly. The war priests particularly presented an
imposing appearance, vested in the blood-red insignia of their rank.
Around their necks were thrown the magic charm collars, with their
pendants of shells, crocodile teeth, and herbs.</p>

<p>About 5 o'clock in the afternoon of the day in question the ceremony
was ushered in in the usual way by several male and female priests. The
warrior priests did not take part till the following day, though during
the night they chanted legendary tales of great Manóbo fights and
fighters. The following morning, however, they led the ceremonies.</p>

<p>During the whole performance there seemed to be no established system
or order. Both warrior priests and others took up the invocation and the
dance as the whim moved or as the opportunity allowed them. One
noteworthy point about the ceremony was the ritual dance of the warrior
priests in honor of their war deities. Attired as they were in the full
panoply of war, with hempen coat and shield, lance, bolo, and dagger,
they romped and pirouetted in turns around the victim to the wild war
tattoo of the drum and the clang of the gong. Imagining the victim to be
some doughty enemy of his, the dancer darted his lance at it back and
forth, now advancing, now retreating, at times hiding behind his shield,
and at others advancing uncovered as if to give the last long lunge.
Under the inspiration of the occasion their eyes gleamed with a fierce
glare and the whole physiognomy was kindled with the fire of war. The
spectators on this particular occasion maintained silence and attention
and manifested considerable fear. It is believed that the warrior
priest, being under the influence of his war god, is liable to commit an
act of violence.</p>

<p>At the time I did not understand the tenor of the invocations that
followed each dance, but was informed that they are such as would be
expected on such an occasion, namely, an invitation to the spirits of
war to partake of the feast and a prayer to them to accompany the party
and assist them in capturing their enemies.</p>

<p>When the moment for the sacrifice arrived the leader of the party,
the chief warrior priest, danced the final dance and, stepping up to the
pig, plunged his spear through its heart, and, applying his mouth to the
wound, drank the blood. Several of the other priests caught the blood in
plates and pans and partook of it in the same manner. The leader put the
blood receptacle under the wound and allowed some of the blood to flow
into it. He then returned it to the diminutive offering house. The
ordinary priests fell into the customary trance, but the war-priest,
together with several of the spectators, took the blood omen. Apparently
this was not favorable, for they ordered the intestines to be removed at
once and examined the gall bladder and the liver.</p>

<p>The priests emerged from their trance and no further ceremonies were
performed except the taking of omens. This occupied several hours and
was performed by little groups, even the young boys trying their hand at
it.</p>

<p>When the pig had been cooked it was set out on the floor and was
partaken of in the usual way. There was little brew on hand. I learned
that on such occasions it is not customary to indulge to any great
extent in drinking.</p>

<p>The party expected to begin the march that afternoon; but as the
scouts had not returned they waited until the next morning.</p>

<p>When the march was about to begin, and while the party still stood on
the river bank, the leader wrenched the head off a chicken and took
observations from the blood and intestines. These were not as
satisfactory as was desired, but were considered favorable enough to
warrant beginning the march tentatively. Upon the entrance of the party
into the forest the omen bird was invoked; its cry proved favorable, and
the march began.</p>

<center>
<a name="4Q5"></a>
<h4>HUMAN SACRIFICE<sup>13</sup></h4>
</center>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Hu-á-ga</i>.</p>

<p>I never witnessed a human sacrifice nor was I ever able to verify the
facts in the locality in which one had occurred, but I have no doubt
that such sacrifices were made occasionally by Manóbos in former
times.</p>

<p>It is not strange that a custom of this kind should exist in a
country where a human being is a mere chattel, sometimes valued at less
than a good dog. When it is considered that in Manóboland revenge is not
only a virtue but a precept, and often a sacred inheritance, it stands
to reason that to sacrifice the life of an enemy or of an enemy's friend
or relative would be an act of the highest merit. From what I have
observed of Manóbo ways I can readily conceive the satisfaction and glee
with which an enemy would be offered up to the war deities of a
settlement, slowly lanced or stabbed to death, and then the heart,
liver, and blood taken ceremonially. A very common expression of anger
used by one Manóbo to another is &#34;<i>huagon ka</i>,&#34; that is,
&#34;May you be sacrificed.&#34;</p>

<p>I find verbal evidences of human sacrifices in those regions only
that are near to the territory of the Bagóbos and the Mandáyas. This
leads me to think that the custom is either of Bagóbo or of Mandáya
origin.</p>

<p>The Jesuit missionary Urios<sup>14</sup> makes mention of the case of
Maliñgáan who lived on the upper Simúlao, contiguous to the Mandáya
country. In order to cure himself of a severe illness he had a little
girl sacrificed. Urios describes the punitive expedition sent out
against him, and the death of Maliñgáan by his own hand.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>Cartas de los PP. de la Compañía de Jesús, Cuaderno V,
letter from Father Saturnine Urios, Patrocinio, Sept. 16, 1881.</p>

<p>I have heard of numerous cases, especially in the region at the
headwaters of the Báobo, Ihawán, and Sábud Rivers. One particular case
will illustrate the manner in which the ceremony is performed. My
authority for the account is one who claimed to have participated in the
sacrifice.</p>

<p>A boy slave, who belonged to the man that arranged the sacrifice, was
selected. The slave was given to understand that the object of the
ceremony was to cure him of a loathsome disease from which he was
suffering.<sup>15</sup> The preparatory ceremonies were described as
being of the same character as those which take place in the ordinary
pig sacrifice for the war spirit, namely, the offering of the betel-nub
tribute, the solemn invocation of the war spirits and supplication for
the recovery of the officiant's son, the sacred dance performed by the
warrior priests, and the offering of betel nut to the soul of the slave
that it might harbor no ill will against the participants in the
ceremony.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup><i>To-bu-káw</i>.</p>

<p>The slave, the narrator informed me, was left unmolested, being
entertained by companions of his age until the moment for the sacrifice
arrived, when he was seized and quickly bound to a tree. The warrior
priest, who was the father of the sick one, then shouted out in a loud
voice to his war spirits asking them to accept the blood of this human
creature, and without further ado planted his dagger in the slave's
breast. Several others, among whom my informant was one, followed suit.
The victim died almost instantly. Then each one of the warrior priests
inserted a crocodile tooth from his neck collar<sup>16</sup> into one of
the wounds and they became, as the narrator put it, <i>tagbusauán</i>;
that is, filled with the blood spirit. The reader is left to imagine the
scene that must have followed.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup><i>Ta-ti-hán</i>.</p>

<p>Human sacrifice takes place in other forms, according to universal
report. Thus one hears now and then that a warrior chief had his young
son kill a slave or a captive in order to receive the spirit of bravery
through the power of a war deity, who would impart to him the desire to
perform feats of valor. Three warrior chiefs informed me personally that
they had done this in order to accustom their young sons to the sight of
blood and to impart to them the spirit of courage. I have no doubt
whatsoever of the truth of their statements, as they were made in a
matter-of-fact, straightforward way, as if the affair were a most
natural occurrence. Accounts of such performances may be overheard when
Manóbos speak among themselves.</p>

<p>There is also another way in which human lives are sacrificed, but it
partakes less of ceremonial character than the two previous methods. I
was given the names of several warrior chiefs who had practiced it. The
following are the details: If the warriors have been lucky enough to
kill an enemy during a fray and at the same time to secure human booty
in the form of captives, they are said on occasions to turn one or more
of these same captives over to their less successful friends in order
that the latter may sate their bloody thirst and feel the full
jubilation of the victory. I was informed that the victims are dragged
out into the near-by forest, speared to death or stabbed, and thrust
with broken bones into a narrow round hole. That this is true I have
every reason to believe, for I heard these reports under circumstances
of a convincing nature. Furthermore, such proceedings would be highly
typical of Manóbo character and would probably occur among any people
that valued human life so lightly and that cherished revenge so dearly.
What could be more natural and more pleasing in the exultation of
victory and in the wildness of its orgies than to deliver a captive,
probably a mortal enemy, to an unsuccessful friend or relative that he
too might glut his vengeance and fill his heart with the full joy of
victory?</p>

<center>
<a name="4R"></a>
<h3>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>
<h3>DIVINATION AND OMENS</h3>

<a name="4R1"></a>
<h4>IN GENERAL</h4>
</center>

<p>The Manóbo not only consults his priest in order to determine the
will of the deities but he himself questions nature at every step of
life and discovers, by what he considers definite and unerring
indications, the course that he may pursue with personal security and
success.</p>

<p>To set down the multitudinous array of these signs would be to
attempt a task of extreme prolixity and one encompassed with infinite
uncertainties and seeming contradictions.</p>

<p>Upon being questioned as to the origin of these manifold omens and
auguries the Manóbo can afford no further information than that they
have been tried for long generations and found to be true. Show him that
on a given occasion the omen bird's cry augured ill but that the
undertaking was a success, and he will explain away the apparent
inconsistency. Show him that the omens were auspicious and that the
enterprise was a failure and he will ascribe the failure to an unnoticed
violation of a taboo or to the infraction of some tribal custom which
aroused the displeasure of a deity.</p>

<p>In every undertaking he must have divine approbation to give him
assurance. If one omen is unsatisfactory, he must consult another, and
if that one fails also, he tries a third, and after various other
trials, if all are unfavorable, he suspends or discontinues the work
until he receives a more favorable answer. After getting a satisfactory
omen he proceeds with the full assurance of success.</p>

<p>There can hardly be said to be professional augurers in Manóboland.
Here and there one finds one with a reputation for skill but this
reputation is never so great as to overcome differences of opinion on
the part of others who also claim to be experts. In fact, where a
combination of good and bad omens occurs, it is customary to hold a long
consultation until the consensus of opinion inclines one way or the
other.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R2"></a>
<h4>MISCELLANEOUS CASUAL OMENS</h4>
</center>

<p>The following are a few of the accidental omens that portend ill:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) Sneezing when heard by one who is about to leave the house,
prognosticates ill luck for him. He must return to the house and wait a
few minutes in order to neutralize the bad influence.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>(2) It is an evil portent to see a snake on the trail. The traveler
must return and wait till next day, or if that can not be done, recourse
must be had to other omens, such as the egg omen, or the suspension
omen, in order to determine beyond a doubt what fortune awaits him.</p>

<p>(3) Should a frog, a large lizard, or any other living creature that
is a stranger to human habitations, enter a house, the portent is
unlucky and means must be taken at once to discover, through divination,
the exact significance of the occurrence. In such cases the egg omen is
tried, and then the suspension omen, and others until no doubt is
entertained as to the significance of the unusual occurrence.</p>

<p>(4) The settling of bees on the gable ornaments of a house, or even
in the immediate vicinity of the house, is a sure intimation of the
approach of a war party or even of certain death, unless the occurrence
has taken place during the rice-planting season and in the new clearing.
The fowl-waving ceremony and the blood lustration must be performed
immediately and other omens taken at once to determine whether these
ceremonies were sufficient to neutralize the threatened danger. I
arrived at a house on the upper Karága, shortly after the occurrence of
this portent, and took part in the countervailing ceremonies. According
to all reports the belief in this omen and the neutralization of it by
the above-mentioned ceremonies is common to Manóbos and Mañgguáñgans.</p>

<p>(5) The howling of a dog while asleep portends evil to the owner.
This omen is considered very serious and the evil of which it is an
intimation must be averted by prompt means. Moreover, the dog must be
sold.</p>

<p>(6) The appearance of shooting stars, meteors, and comets
prognosticates sickness.</p>

<p>(7) The breaking of a plate or of a pot before an intended trip is of
such evil import that the trip is postponed until the following day.</p>

<p>(8) The discovery of blood on an object when no satisfactory
explanation of its presence can be found is an omen of very evil
import.</p>

<p>(9) The nibbling of clothes by mice is an evil sign, and, though the
clothes need not be discarded, neutralizing means must be resorted
to.</p>

<p>(10) The finding of a dead animal on the farm is of highly evil
import and no means should be left untried toward offsetting the
threatened ill.</p>

<p>(11) The crying of birds at night is considered ominous; the sound is
thought to be the voice of evil spirits who with intent to do harm have
metamorphosed themselves into the form of birds.</p> </blockquote>

<h4>DIVINATION BY DREAMS</h4>
</center>

<p>As already stated, dreams are believed to be pictures of the doings
of the soul companions of the Manóbo and in some mystic way are thought
to foreshadow his own fate. Should a person yell in his sleep it is a
proof that his soul or spirit is in danger, and he must be instantly
aroused but not rudely.<sup>2</sup> The belief in dreams is strong and
abiding and plays no small part in the Manóbo's religious life.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>If not awakened at once he may fall into a condition in
which he is said to be <i>pa-ga-tam-ái-un</i>, a term that I have failed
to learn the meaning of.</p>

<p>The interpretation of them, however, is so variable and so involved
in apparent contradictions that I have obtained little definite and
reliable information. In cases where Manóbo experts differ, and where
other forms of divination have to be employed to determine whether a
dream is to be considered ominous or otherwise, it is not suprising[sic]
that a stranger should have received little enlightenment on the
subject.</p>

<p>Much more importance attaches to the dreams of the priest than to
those of ordinary individuals, for the former are thought to have a more
general application and to be more definite in their significance. But
the difficulty of interpretation may frequently make the dream of no
value because it may happen that the future must be determined by
recourse to other divinatory methods.</p>

<p>There is a general belief that both the ordinary priest and the
warrior chief may receive a knowlege[sic] of future events in their
dreams and also may receive medicine, but I know of only one case in
which the latter claim was made. In that case a priest maintained that
he had been instructed in a dream to fish for eels the following day. He
stated that he had done so and that he had found a bezoar stone which he
had given to a sick relative of his.</p>

<p>However, when once the dream has been interpreted to the satisfaction
of the dream experts as ill-boding, means must be taken immediately to
avert the impending evil. A common method of doing this is by the
fowl-waving ceremony and in serious cases by the blood-lustration
rite.</p>

<h4>DIVINATION BY GEOMETRICAL FIGURES</h4>

<a name="4R41"></a>
<h5>THE VINE<sup>3</sup> OMEN</h5>
</center>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Bu-dá-kan</i>, a species of creeper.</p>

<p>I witnessed the taking of this omen both in 1905, before the war
expedition referred to on previous pages, and also at the time of the
selection of a new town site for the town of Monacayo[sic] on the upper
Agúsan. As a rule the omen is taken on occasions of this kind. The
procedure in the rite is as follows:</p>

<p>A piece of a vine one fathom long is cut up into pieces the length of
the middle finger; these pieces are then arranged as in the figure shown
herewith as far as the number of the pieces permits. The sides of the
square and the pieces which radiate from the corners are first laid in
position. One piece is then placed in the center, and those which remain
are set at right angles to the rectangle. (See fig. 2<i>c</i>,
<i>e</i>.)</p>

<p>The six pieces of vine that are set at right angles to the rectangle,
as in figure 2<i>a</i>, represent the ladders or poles by which entrance
is gained to the house, represented in this case by the rectangle
itself. The pieces that radiate from the four corners represent the
posts that support the house. Now, whenever the pieces of vine are not
sufficient to form even one &#34;ladder,&#34; it is evident that all
hopes of entering the house and getting the enemy are vain. The
principle of the omen consists in the observation of the presence and
number of ladders, and of the length of the central piece which
represents the inmates of the house to be attacked. The following are
some of the main and more intelligible figures.</p>

<a name="F2"></a>
<img src="IMAGES/FIGURE02.JPG" alt="FIGURE 2">

<p>As there is no side piece or &#34;ladder&#34; in Figure 2<i>b</i>,
<i>c</i> it is a sign that the house of the opponent can not be entered.
In Figure 2<i>c</i> the shortness of the central piece is an indication
that one of the attacking party will be wounded. This configuration is
called <i>lahúñgan</i><sup>4</sup> and is very inauspicious.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>From <i>la-húñg</i>, to carry on a pole between two or
more persons.</p>

<p>In Figure 2<i>d</i> the necessary ladders are present and the inmates
of the house will be reached. The omen is favorable and is called
<i>hagdanan</i>.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p><sup>5</sup>From <i>hágdan</i>, a pole ladder.</p>

<p>In Figure 2<i>e</i> there are the necessary means of getting access
to the house as may be seen by the presence of the three
&#34;ladders&#34; at right angles to the house. Moreover, the piece
representing the inmates is shorter, an indication of great slaughter.
This is a most favorable omen and, as there will be great weeping as a
result of the killing, it is called luha'an.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p><sup>6</sup>From <i>lú-ha</i>, a tear.</p>

<p>In Figure 2<i>f</i> the absence of a piece within the rectangle is
symbolical of the flight of the inmates of the house so that the
intended attack is put off for a few days and a few scouts sent forward
to reconnoiter.</p>

<p>There are several other combinations to which different
interpretations may be given according to whether the omen is employed
for a war expedition or for the selection of a new site, but the above
figures give a general idea of this method of divination.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p><sup>7</sup>The interpretation of these figures can not be given in
greater detail because the Manóbos themselves can not always give
consistent explanations of them.</p>

<p>Should the above omen prove unfavorable, the sacrifice of a
pig<sup>8</sup> or of a chicken in honor of the leader's war gods should
be performed, and then another attempt to secure a favorable omen by the
use of the vine may be made.</p>

<a name="4R42"></a>
<h5>THE RATTAN OMEN<sup>9</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>9</sup><i>Tí-ko</i>.</p>

<p>The rattan-frond omen is taken to determine either the success of a
prospective attack or the suitability of a new site for a house or farm.
The observation is performed in the following way: A frond of rattan one
fathom in length is taken and its midrib is cut into pieces each the
length of the middle finger, as in the preceding omen, but in such a way
that each piece of the midrib retains spikes, one on each side. These
two spikes are then tied together, thus forming a kind of a ring or leaf
circle. All these leaf circles are taken in one hand and thrown up into
the air. Should any of these circlets be found entwined or stuck
together when they reach the ground the omen is considered unlucky, for
it denotes that one or more of the enemy will engage in a hand-to-hand
fight with the attacking party.<sup>10</sup> Should, however, the
different leaf circles reach the ground without becoming entangled, the
omen is excellent. There are a great variety of possible interpretations
arising from the number of tangles, each one of which has a special name
and a special import, but I am unable to give any further reliable
information as to these. This rattan-frond omen appears to be used very
rarely. In fact, in some districts no great reliance seems to be placed
on it by many with whom I conversed.<sup>11</sup></p>

<p><sup>10</sup>The omen is then said to be <i>na-ba-ká-an</i>. The
exact meaning of this term, I am unable to state.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>For other omens of a similar nature see Chapter XXVI.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R5"></a>
<h4>DIVINATION BY SUSPENSION AND OTHER METHODS</h4>

<a name="4R51"></a>
<h5>THE SUSPENSION OMEN</h5>
</center>

<p>The ordinary manner of divining future events by this method is to
suspend a bolo or a dagger that has been consecrated to a deity and from
its movement, or from the absence of movement, obtain the desired
information. In case of emergency such a common-place object as an old
smoking pipe may be used.</p>

<p>The object is suspended, preferably in front of a sacrificial tray,
or table, and then questioned just as if it were a thing of life. The
answers are somewhat limited, being confined to &#34;yes&#34; and
&#34;no,&#34; and are expressed by the faint and silent movement or by
the utter quietude of the object suspended. Movement denotes an
affirmative response to the question, quietude or lack of movement a
negative answer.</p>

<p>I was often struck with the childlike simplicity displayed by the
taker of the oracle In the particular case wherein a pipe was employed,
the party wished to discover whether it would be safe for him to proceed
on a journey the following day. The pipe by a slight gyratory motion at
once intimated its assent. He then besought it to make no mistake, and,
after carefully stilling the movement of his oracle, repeated the
question two different times, receiving each time an affirmative answer.
The consultation was made within a heavy hempen mosquito net of
<i>abaká</i> fiber, and, as the pipe had been suspended in a position
where the heated air from the candle could affect it, it is not
surprising that it displayed a tendency to be in constant movement.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R52"></a>
<h5>THE OMEN FROM EGGS<sup>12</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Ti-maí-ya to a-tá-yug</i>.</p>

<p>A fresh egg, or one that is known still to be in good condition, is
broken in two and the contents gently emptied into a plate or bowl. If
the white and the yoke remain separated, the omen is favorable but if
they should mix, it is of ominous import. Should the egg prove to be
rotten, the omen is thought to be evil in the extreme. I never in a
single instance witnessed the failure of this omen. I was informed,
however, that on occasions it has proved unfavorable.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R6"></a>
<h4>DIVINATION BY SACRIFICIAL APPEARANCES</h4>
</center>

<p>Hieromancy is a form of divination that is resorted to on all
occasions where the object of a sacrifice is one of very great
importance. I witnessed this form of divination practiced upon the
departure of a war party in the upper Agúsan in 1907.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R61"></a>
<h5>THE BLOOD OMEN</h5>
</center>

<p>The blood from the neck of a sacrificed chicken or from the side of a
pig is caught, usually in a bowl. If it is found to be of a bright,
spotless red, without any frothing or bubbles, the omen is excellent,
but the appearance of foam or dark spots, or blotches is regarded as
indicative of evil in a greater or less degree according to the number
and size of the spots. The appearance of circular streaks in the blood
is highly favorable, as it is taken as an indication that the enemy will
be completely encircled, thereby assuring the capture of all the enemy
or their annihilation. In this, as in all other omens, the
interpretation is given by those who are considered experts. I can
afford no reliable information as to the rules governing the
interpretation. Answers to inquiries show that in the interpretation of
this omen there is involved an infinity of contradictions,
uncertainties, and intricacies.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R62"></a>
<h5>THE NECK OMEN</h5>
</center>

<p>Before the expedition referred to above I observed a peculiar method
of determining which of the warriors would distinguish himself.</p>

<p>The leader of the expedition seized a fowl, made a short invocation,
wrenched the head from the body and allowed the blood of the beheaded
bird to flow into a bowl. When all the blood had been caught in this
vessel, the leader held up the still writhing fowl, leaving the neck
free. Then several of those present addressed the fowl, beseeching it to
point out the ones who would display most valor during the attack.
Naturally, through the violent action of the muscles, the neck was
twisted momentarily in a certain direction. This signified that the
person in whose direction it pointed would show especial courage during
the fray. The fowl was questioned a second and a third time with the
result that it always pointed more or less in the direction of some one
of the party famed for his prowess, which person was then and there
acclaimed as one of the Hectors of the coming fight.</p>

<p>I was repeatedly assured that this omen is always consulted before
all war expeditions<sup>13</sup> or war raids. In the lake region of the
Agúsan Valley the omen is interpreted differently for it is said to be
good if the neck finally twists itself towards the east or towards the
north.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>Mañg-ái-yau</i> is a word used by nearly all tribes
in Mindanáo to express a band of warriors on a raid, or the raid itself.
Mr. H. O. Beyer, of the Bureau of Science, tells me that the word is
used also by some northern Luzon tribes. I myself found it in use by the
Negritos of the Gumaín and Kauláman rivers in western Pampanga.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R63"></a>
<h5>THE OMEN FROM THE GALL</h5>
</center>

<p>The only rule with regard to the gall bladder is that it should be of
normal size in order to denote success. An unusually large, or an
unusually small one, prognosticate, respectively, misfortune or
failure.<sup>14</sup> When the gall bladder is unusually large, however,
the omen gives rise to great misgivings and calls for a very careful
observance of the following omen, for it portends not only failure but
disaster.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>In the former case the omen is said to be <i>gu-tús</i>
and in the latter case <i>gí-pus</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R64"></a>
<h5>THE OMEN FROM THE LIVER</h5>
</center>

<p>This omen is taken from the liver of pigs only. In the observation of
it dark spots and blotches are an indication of evil and are counted and
examined as to size and form. For all of these there is a corresponding
interpretation, varying, probably, according to the idiosyncrasies of
each individual augur.</p>

<p>On occasions of great importance such as war raids, or epidemics,
this omen is always consulted. But it is taken with great frequency in
other contingencies as an auxiliary omen to overcome the influence of
previous evil ones.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R65"></a>
<h5>THE OMEN FROM A FOWL'S INTESTINAL APPENDIX<sup>15</sup></h5>
</center>

<p><sup>15</sup><i>Pós-ud</i>. This appendix is a small blind projection
found on the intestines of fowls.</p>

<p>I have never determined whether the appendix of a pig is a subject
for augury or not. If it is, it escaped my observation. The appendix of
a chicken, however, is invariably observed as an auxiliary to the
observation of the liver and the gall of a pig. If it is found to be
erect, that is, at right angles to the intestine, it is considered a
favorable omen but if found in a horizontal or supine position with
reference to the intestine, it is said to be highly inauspicious. In
every case which I saw the omen was favorable.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R7"></a>
<h4>ORNITHOSCOPY</h4>

<a name="4R71"></a>
<h5>IN GENERAL</h5>
</center>

<p>Divination by birds is confined practically to the
turtledove.<sup>16</sup> This homely inert creature is considered the
harbinger of good and evil, and is consulted at the beginning of every
journey and of every undertaking where its prophetic voice can be heard.
Should its cry forebode ill, the undertaking is discontinued no matter
how urgent it may be. But should the cry presage good, then the project
is taken up or continued with renewed assurance and a glad heart, for is
not this bird the envoy of the deities and its voice a divine
message?</p>

<p><sup>16</sup><i>Li-mó-kon</i>.</p>

<p>No arguments can shake the Manóbo's<sup>17</sup> faith in the trusty
omen bird. For him it can not err, it is infallible. For every case you
cite him of its errors, he quotes you numberless cases where its
prophecies have come true, and ends by attributing the instance you cite
to a false interpretation or to divine intervention that saved you from
the evil prognosticated by the bird.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>Mandáyas, Mañgguáñgans, Debabáons, and Banuáons of the
Agúsan Valley have practically the same beliefs as the Manóbos in regard
to this omen bird.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R72"></a>
<h5>RESPECT TOWARD THE OMEN BIRD</h5>
</center>

<p>The omen bird is never killed, for to kill it would draw down
unmitigated misfortune. On the contrary, it is often captured and is
carefully fed and petted, especially when an inmate of the house is
about to undertake a journey. The prospective traveler takes a little
<i>camote</i> or banana and, placing it in the cage, addresses the
captive bird and asks it to sing to its companions of the woods that
they too in turn may sing to him the song of success and safe return.</p>

<p>And again, on the safe return of the traveler, if there is a captive
omen bird in his household, it is a common practice to feed it and give
it drink, addressing it tenderly as if it had been the cause of the
success of the trip.</p>

<p>When the undertaking is one of importance, such as the selection of a
site for a new clearing, or one fraught with possible danger, such as a
trip into a dangerous locality, the free wild bird of the woods and not
the captive bird is solemnly invoked.<sup>18</sup> It is requested to
sing out its warning or its auspicious song in clear unmistakable tones.
Before a war expedition an offering of rice is set out on a log near the
house as a further inducement to it to be propitious.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup><i>Táu-ag-táu-ag to li-mó-kon</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R73"></a>
<h5>INTERPRETATION OF THE OMEN BIRD'S CALL</h5>
</center>

<p>It frequently requires an expert to interpret exactly the meaning of
the various positions from which the bird has sung and in certain cases
even several experts can not arrive at a consensus of opinion. Hence the
following interpretation is intended as a mere general outline from
which an idea may be gained of the intricacies and sometimes apparent
contradictions involved in Manóbo ornithoscopy.</p>

<p>The observations may be divided into three kinds, good, bad, and
indifferent, and these three kinds into infinite combinations, for the
interpretation of the first original observation may be modified and
remodified by subsequent cries proceeding from other directions. Thus
what was originally a good omen, may become, in conjunction with
subsequent ones, most fatal.</p>

<p>The directions of the calls are calculated from eight general
positions of the bird with reference to the person making the
observation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) Directly in front.</p>

<p>(2) Directly behind.</p>

<p>(3) Directly at right angles on the right.</p>

<p>(4) Directly at right angles on the left.</p>

<p>(5) In front to the right and at an angle of 45°.</p>

<p>(6) In front to the left and at an angle of 45°.</p>

<p>(7) Behind to the right and at an angle of 45°.</p>

<p>(8) Behind to the left and at an angle of 45°.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first direction is bad. It denotes the meeting of obstacles that
are not necessarily of a very serious character unless subsequent
observations lead to such a conclusion. The trip need not be
discontinued but vigilance must be exerted.</p>

<p>The second direction<sup>19</sup> is also bad. It is a sign that
behind one there are obstacles or impediments such as sickness in the
family. The trip must not be undertaken or continued until the following
day.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>Called <i>ga-biñg</i>.</p>

<p>The third and fourth directions<sup>20</sup> are indeterminate. One's
fate is unknown until subsequent omen cries reveal the future, hence all
ears are alert.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>On the upper Agúsan it is called <i>bá-us-bá-us</i>, on
the central, <i>bí-tang</i>.</p>

<p>The fifth direction<sup>21</sup> is good and one may proceed with
full assurance of success.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>Called <i>bág-to</i>.</p>

<p>The sixth position<sup>22</sup> merely guarantees safety to life and
limb but one must not be sanguine of attaining the object of the
trip.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>Also called <i>bág-to</i>.</p>

<p>The seventh and eighth directions are like the second direction; that
is, bad.</p>

<p>Between the above directions are others that receive an intermediate
interpretation. There may also be combinations of calls from different
directions. The omen bird heard in the fifth or in the sixth direction
augurs success and safety, respectively, as we saw above, but if heard
simultaneously from those two positions it is considered a most fatal
omen; the trip or enterprise must be abandoned at once. Again if the
bird calls from the fifth position and then after a short interval from
the eighth position, success is assured but upon arriving at the
destination one must hurry home without delay.</p>

<p>Should, however, the cry proceed from the sixth direction and then be
immediately followed by one from the seventh, great vigilance must be
exerted, for the cry is an intimation that one will have to use his
shield and spear in defense.</p>

<p>I have found the interpretation of the omen bird's call so varied and
so difficult that I refrain from entering any further into the matter.
Suffice it to say that at the beginning of every journey the bird is
consulted and its call interpreted to the best of the traveler's
ability. Should it be decided that the call augurs ill he invariably
abandons the trip until the following day when he makes another attempt
to secure favorable omens. It thus happens that his journey may be
delayed for several days. On one occasion I was delayed three days
because the cry of this mysterious bird was unfavorable.</p>

<center>
<a name="4R74"></a>
<h5>BIRDS OF EVIL OMEN</h5>
</center>

<p>Besides the turtledove there is no other bird that is the harbinger
of good luck. There are, however, several that by their cry, forebode
evil. Thus the cry of all birds that ordinarily do not cry by night is
of evil omen. The various species of hornbills, crows, and chickens are
examples. The cawing of crows and the shrieking of owls in the night
have a particularly evil significance, for these birds are then
considered to be the embodiment of demons that hover around with evil
intent.</p>

<p>An unusual cackling of a hen at night without any apparent reason is
also of ill import. On one occasion it was thought to be so threatening
that the following morning the owner went through the fowl-waving
ceremony and killed the hen for breakfast. He told me that he had to
kill it or to sell it because bad luck might come if he kept it around
the house.</p>

<p>Again, the alighting of a large bird, such as a hornbill, on the
house forebodes great evil. Ceremonial means must be taken without delay
to avert the evil presaged by such an occurrence. On one occasion I
observed the fowl-waving ceremony, the sacrifice of a chicken, and the
blood lustration performed with a view to neutralizing the evil
portent.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>
<h3>MYTHOLOGICAL AND KINDRED BELIEFS</h3

<br>
<a name="4S1">
<h4>THE CREATION OF THE WORLD</h4>
</center>

<p>The story of the creation of the world varies throughout the Agúsan
Valley. In the district surrounding Talakógon creation is attributed to
</a>Makalídung, the first great Manóbo. The details of his work are very
meager. He set the world up on posts, some say iron posts, with one in
the center. At this central post he has his abode, in company with a
python, according to the version of some, and whenever he feels
displeasure toward men he shakes the post, thereby producing an
earthquake and at the same time intimating to man his anger. It is
believed that should the trembling continue the world would be
destroyed.</p>

<p>In the same district it is believed that the sky is round and that
its extremities are at the limits of the sea. Somewhere near these
limits is an enormous hole called &#34;the navel of the
sea,&#34;<sup>1</sup> through which the waters descend and ascend. This
explains the rise and the fall of the tide.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup><i>Pó-sud to dá-gat</i>.</p>

<p>It is said that in the early days of creation the sky was low, but
that one day a woman, while pounding rice, hit it with her pestle, and
it ascended to its present position.</p>

<p>Another version of the creation, prevalent among the Manóbos of the
Argáwan and Híbung Rivers, gives the control of the world to
<i>Dágau</i>, who lives at the four fundamental pillars in the company
of a python. Being a woman, she dislikes the sight of human blood, and
when it is spilled upon the face of the earth she incites the huge
serpent to wreathe itself around the pillars and shake the world to its
foundations. Should she become exceedingly angry she diminishes the
supply of rice either by removing it from the granary or by making the
soil unproductive.</p>

<p>According to another variation of the story, which is heard on the
upper Agúsan, on the Simúlau, and on the Umaíam, the world is like a
huge mushroom and it is supported upon an iron pillar in the center.
This pillar is controlled by the higher and more powerful order of
deities who, on becoming angered at the actions of men, manifest their
feelings by shaking the pillar, thereby reminding mortals of their
duties.</p>

<center>
<a name="4S2"></a>
<h4>CELESTIAL PHENOMENA</h4>

<a name="4S21"></a>
<h5>THE RAINBOW</h5>
</center>

<p>The rainbow, according to the general account, is an inexplicable
manifestation of the gods of war. At one end of the rainbow there is
thought to be a huge tortoise, one fathom broad. The appearance of the
rainbow is an indication that the gods of war, with their associate war
chiefs and warriors from the land of death, have gone forth in search of
blood. If red predominates among the colors of the rainbow it is thought
that the mightier war spirits are engaged in hand-to-hand combat; but if
the colors are dark, it is a sign of slaughter. If the rainbow should
seem to approach, precautions are taken to defend the house against
attack, as it is believed that a real war party is approaching.</p>

<p>On no account must the finger be pointed at the rainbow, as it might
become curved.</p>

<center>
<a name="4S22"></a>
<h5>THUNDER AND LIGHTNING</h5>
</center>

<p>Thunder is a demonstration by Anit of her anger towards men for
disrespect to brute animals. Lightning is spoken of as her tongue and is
described as being a reddish tongue-shaped stone that is flung by her at
the guilty one. Anit is one of the mighty spirits that dwell in
Inugtúhan, the sky world, and together with Inaíyau is the wielder of
the thunderbolt and of the storm.</p>

<p>She is a very watchful spirit and, in case one offends her, he must
hurry to a house and get a priest to appease her with an offering of
blood. The belief in this tongue stone is universal, but no one claims
to have seen one nor can anyone tell where it can be found.</p>

<h5>ECLIPSE OF THE MOON</h5>

<p>The almost universal belief regarding an eclipse of the moon is that
a gigantic tarantula<sup>2</sup> has attacked the moon and is slowly
encompassing it in its loathsome embrace. Upon perceiving the first
evidences of darkness upon the face of the moon, the men rush out from
the houses, shout, shoot arrows toward the moon, slash at trees with
their bolos, play the drum and gong, beat tin cans and the buttresses of
trees, blow bamboo resounders and dance around wildly, at the same time
giving forth yells of defiance at the monster saying, &#34;Let loose our
moon,&#34; &#34;You will be hit by an arrow.&#34; The women at the same
time keep sticking needles or pointed sticks in the wall in the
direction of the enemy that is trying to envelop the moon.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup><i>Tam-ban-a-káu-a</i>. (Bisáya, <i>ba-ka-náu-a</i>.)
Some say that a huge scorpion is the cause of eclipses.</p>

<p>The explanation of these curious proceedings is simple. If the moon
does not become freed from the clutches of this gigantic creature, it is
believed that there will be no dawn and that, in the eternal darkness
that will subsequently fall upon the world, the evil spirits will reign
and all human apparel will be turned into snakes.</p>

<p>During the eclipse the priests never cease to call upon their deities
for aid against the mighty tarantula that is menacing the moon.</p>

<p>As to the origin, habitat, and character of this tarantula I have
never been afforded the least information. The huge creature seizes upon
the moon, but soon releases it on account of the shouts and menacing
actions of the human spectators. Objections that one may raise as to the
invisibility, magnitude, and other obvious anomalies are at once refuted
by the simple and sincere declaration that such belief is true because
it has been handed down from the days of yore.</p>

<h5>ORIGIN OF THE STARS AND THE EXPLANATION OF SUNSET AND SUNRISE</h5>
</center>

<p>It is said that in the olden time the sun and the moon were married.
They led a peaceful, harmonious life and two children were the result of
their wedlock. One day the moon had to attend to one of the household
duties that fall to the lot of a woman--some say to get water, others
say to get the daily supply of food from the little farm. Before
departing she crooned the children to sleep and told her husband to
watch them but not to approach them lest, by the heat that radiated from
his body he might harm them. She then started upon her errand. The sun,
who never before had been allowed to touch his bairns, arose and
approached their sleeping place. He gazed upon them fondly and, bending
down, kissed them, but the intense heat that issued from his countenance
melted them like wax. Upon preceiving[sic] this he wept and quietly
betook himself to the adjoining forest in great fear of his wife.</p>

<p>The moon returned duly and, after laying down her burden in the
house, turned to where the children slept, but found only their
inanimate forms. She broke out into a loud wail, and in the wildness of
her grief called upon her husband. But he gave no answer. Finally
softened by the long loud plaints he returned to his house. At the sight
of him the wild cries of grief and of despair and of rebuke redoubled
themselves until finally the husband, unable to soothe his wife, became
angry and called her his chattel.<sup>3</sup> At first she feared his
anger and quieted her sobs, but finally, breaking out into one long
wail, she seized the burnt forms of her babes and in the depth of her
anguish and her rage, threw them out on the ground in different
directions. Then the husband became angry again and, seizing some taro
leaves that his wife had brought from the farm, cast them in her face
and went his way. Upon his return he could not find his wife, and so it
is to this day that the sun follows the moon in an eternal cycle of
night and day. And so it is, too, that the stars stand scattered in the
sable firmament, for they are her discarded children that accompany her
in her hasty flight. Ever and anon a shooting star breaks across her
path, but that is only a messenger from her husband to call her back.
She, however, heeds it not but speeds on her way in never-ending flight
with the marks of the taro leaves<sup>4</sup> still upon her face, and
with her starry train accompanying her to the dawn and on to the sunset
in one eternal flight.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup><i>Máñg-gad</i> (chattel) and <i>bin-ó-tuñg</i> (purchase
slave) are the ordinary terms of reproach used by an angry husband
toward his wife and refer to her domestic status as originating in the
marriage payment.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>Some say that spots upon the moon are a cluster of
bamboos; others, that they are <i>baléte</i> trees, and others again,
that they are the taro marks referred to.</p>

<h4>THE STORY OF THE IKÚGAN,<sup>5</sup> OR TAILED MEN, AND OF THE
RESETTLEMENT OF THE AGÚSAN VALLEY</h4>
</center>

<p><sup>5</sup>From <i>i-kug</i>, tail.</p>

<p>It seems that long, long ago a ferocious horde of tailed men,
Tíduñg,<sup>6</sup> overran the Agúsan Valley as far south as Veruéla.
They were tailed men from all accounts, the tail of the men being like a
dagger, and that of the women like an adze of the kind used by Manóbos.
For 14 years they continued their depredations, devastating the whole
valley till all the Manóbos had fled or been killed, except one woman on
the Argáwan River or, as some say, on the Umaíam.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>It would be interesting to know whether these Tíduñg were
members of a tribe in Borneo that made piratical raids to the Súlu
Archipelago.</p>

<p>When the Manóbos first arrived in the Agúsan Valley they tried to
withstand the tailed men. The Manóbos of the Kasilaían River are said to
have dug trenches and to have made valiant resistance, but were finally
obliged to flee to the Pacific coast.<sup>7</sup> It is said that when
encamped near the present site of San Luis these tailed folks slept on a
kind of nettle<sup>8</sup> and being severely stung, took it for a bad
omen and returned.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>It is true that the Manóbos of the Tágo River, province
of Surigao, claim kinship with those of the Kasilaían and Argáwan
Rivers, but their migration from the Agúsan Valley seems to have been
comparatively recent, if I may believe their own testimony.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Ság-ui</i>.</p>

<p>As to the origin and departure of these invaders nothing seems to be
known, but they devastated the valley from Butuán to Veruéla and from
east to west.</p>

<p>The solitary woman who had hidden in the <i>runo</i> reeds of Argáwan
continued to eke out an existence and to pass her time in weaving
<i>abaká</i> cloth. One day as she was about to eat she found a
turtledove's egg in one of her weaving baskets and she was glad, for
meat and fish were scarce. But when the hour to eat arrived she forgot
the egg. Thus it happened day after day until the egg hatched out, when
lo! instead of a little dove there appeared a lovely little baby girl
who, under her foster mother's care and guidance, throve and grew to
woman's estate.</p>

<p>Now it happened that, as the war had ended, scouts began to travel
through the country to discover whether the Ikúgan had really departed,
and one day a band of them found the woman and foster daughter. Amazed
at the young girl's marvelous beauty the chief asked for her hand. The
foster mother granted his request, but upon one condition--that he would
place a married couple upon every river in the valley. Well pleased with
such a simple condition he started upon his quest and before long
succeeded in placing upon every river a married couple. In this way came
about the repopulation of the Agúsan Valley. The chief then married the
beautiful maiden and peace reigned throughout the land.</p>

<h4>GIANTS</h4>
</center>

<p>The great mythic giants of Manóboland are <i>Táma</i>,
<i>Mandayáñgan</i>, and <i>Apíla</i>. All three are described as of
marvelous height, &#34;as tall as the tallest trees of the
mountains,&#34; and their domain is said to be the deep and dark
forest.</p>

<p><i>Táma</i> is a wicked spirit, whose special malignancy consists in
beguiling the steps of unwary travelers. Leading his victim off the
beaten trail by cunning calls and other ruses, he devours him bodily.
His haunt is said to be sometimes the balete tree, as the enormous
footprints occasionally seen in its vicinity testify. A Manóbo of the
Kasilaían River assured me that he had seen them and that they were a
fathom long. I have heard various accounts of this fabulous being all
over eastern Mindanáo.</p>

<p><i>Mandayáñgan</i>, on the contrary, is a good-natured, humanlike
giant, who loves to attend the combats of Manóboland. He is said to have
been one of the great warriors of the days of yore. His dwelling is in
the great mountain forests, where live the gods of war.</p>

<p><i>Apíla</i> is an innocuous giant whose one great pleasure is to
leave his far-off forest home and, crashing down the timber in his giant
strides, go in quest of a wrestling bout with Mandayáñgan. The noise of
their fierce engagement can be heard, it is said, for many and many a
league, and there are not wanting those who have witnessed their mighty
struggle for supremacy.</p>

<p>Besides these three greater giants, there are others, lesser but more
human, the principal of whom is <i>Dábau</i>. <i>Dábau</i> lived on a
small mountain in view of the present site of Veruéla. It is said that,
before beginning his trip up the Agúsan, he sent word to the inhabitants
of the Umaíam River that on a certain day he would pass through the lake
region and that all rice should be carefully protected against the
commotion of the waters.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p><sup>9</sup>The nearest settlements to the channel through which
<i>Dábau</i> must have passed were several kilometers distant.</p>

<p>On the appointed day he is said to have seized the trunk of a
<i>palma brava</i> palm and, using it for a pole, to have poled his
bamboo raft from Butuán to the mouth of the Maásin Creek, near Veruéla,
in one day.<sup>10</sup> With him lived his sister, also a person of
extraordinary strength, for it is on record that she would at times
pluck a whole bunch of bananas and throw it to her brother on a
neighboring hill.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>This trip is a row of from 8 to 12 days in a large
native canoe and under normal conditions.</p>

<center>
<a name="4S5"></a>
<h4>PECULIAR ANIMAL BELIEFS</h4>
</center>

<p>There is, besides the various omens taken from birds, bees, dogs, and
mice, a very peculiar observance prevailing among the tribes of eastern
Mindanáo with regard to members of the animal kingdom. This strange
observance consists in paying them a certain deference in that they must
not be laughed at, imitated, nor in anywise shown disrespect. This
statement applies particularly to those creatures which enter a human
haunt contrary to their usual custom. To laugh at them, or make jeering
remarks as to their appearance, etc., would provoke the wrath of
Anítan<sup>11</sup> the thunder goddess, who dwells in Inugtúhan. If
they enter the house, they must be driven out in a gentlemanly way and
divinatory means resorted to at once, for they may portend ill luck.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>Called also <i>Á-nit</i> and <i>In-a-ní-tan</i>.</p>

<p>I have myself at times been upbraided for my levity toward frogs and
other animals. I also received numerous accounts of disrespect shown to
brute visitors to a house and of the ill results that might have
followed had not proper and timely propitiation been made to Anítan. The
two following incidents, of which the narrators were a part, will
sufficiently illustrate the point.</p>

<p>Two Manóbos of the Kasilaían River entered a house and, upon
perceiving a chicken that was afflicted with a cold, began to make
unseemly remarks to it by upbraiding it for getting wet. Shortly after
it began to thunder and, remembering the offense that they had
committed, they had recourse to their aunt, a priestess, who decided
that Anítan was displeased and had to be propitiated. Finding no other
victim than a hunting dog, for the chicken was considered by her
ceremonially unclean, she at once ordered the dog to be killed for
Anítan. The thunder and the lightning passed away promptly. It may be
noted here that the dog may have had considerable value, for a really
good hunting dog commands as high a value as a human life.</p>

<p>In another case on the same river the narrator had captured a young
monkey. When he arrived at the house its uncouth appearance caused a
little merriment and induced the owner to place upon its head a small
earthen pot in imitation of a hat. Almost immediately the first
mutterings of thunder were heard, and the owner, remembering his
indiscretion, slew the monkey and offered it in propitiation to Anítan.
As he had expected he averted the danger that he feared from the
threating[sic] thunderbolts.</p>

<p>In some cases those who are guilty of this peculiar offense become
turned into stone, unless they take the proper means of appeasing divine
wrath, as the following legend will show.</p>

<center>
<a name="4S6"></a>
<h5>THE PETRIFIED CRAFT AND CREW OF KAGBUBÁTAÑG</h5>
</center>

<p>In the old, old days a boat was passing the rocky promontory of
Kagbubátañg.<sup>12</sup> The occupants espied a monkey and a cat
fighting upon the summit of the promontory. The incongruity of the thing
impressed them and they began to give vent to derisive remarks,
addressing themselves to the brute combatants, when lo and behold, they
and their craft were turned into stone, and to this day the petrified
craft and crew may be seen on the promontory and all who pass must make
an offering,<sup>13</sup> howsoever small it be, to the vexed souls of
these petrified people. If one were to pass the point without making an
offering, the anger of its petrified inhabitants might be aroused and
the traveler might have bad weather and rough seas.<sup>14</sup></p>

<p><sup>12</sup><i>Kag-bu-bá-tañg</i> is a point within sight of the
town of Placer, eastern Mindanáo.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>The offering may consist of a little piece of wood, in
fact anything, and must be thrown overboard while one is passing the
point.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>There is said to be a similar locality near Taganíto,
between Clavér and Carrascál.</p>

<p>In further explanation of this singular belief it may be stated that
the imitation of the sounds made by frogs is especially forbidden, for
it might be followed not merely by thunderbolts, as in some cases, but
by petrifaction of the offender; in proof of this I will adduce the
legend of Añgó, of Bináoi.<sup>15</sup></p>

<p><sup>15</sup><i>Bin-á-oi</i> is the name of an oddly shaped peak at
the source of the River Añgadanán, tributary of the Wá-wa River. From
the upper Tágo its white crest may be seen overlooking the source of the
stream Malitbug that delivers its waters to the Tágo River through the
Borubuán.</p>

<center>
<a name="4S7"></a>
<h5>AÑGÓ, THE PETRIFIED MANÓBO</h5>
</center>

<p>Añgó lived many years ago on a lofty peak in the eastern Cordillera
with his wife and children. One day he went to the forest with his dogs
in quest of game. Fortune granted him a fine big boar, but he broke his
spear in dealing the mortal blow. Upon arriving at a stream he sat down
upon a stone and set himself to repairing his spear. The croaking of the
near-by frogs attracted his attention and, imitating their shrill notes,
he boldly told them that it would be better to cease their cries and
help him mend his spear. He continued his course up the rocky torrent,
but noticed that a multitude of little stones began to follow behind in
his path. Surprised at such a happening he hastened his steps. Looking
back, he saw bigger stones join in the pursuit. He then seized his dog
and in fear began to run but the stones kept on in hot pursuit, bigger
and bigger ones joining the party. Upon arriving at his <i>camote</i>
patch he was exhausted and had to slacken his pace, whereupon the stones
overtook him and one became attached to his finger. He could not go on.
He called upon his wife. She, with the young children, sought the magic
lime<sup>16</sup> and set it around her husband, but all to no avail,
for his feet began to turn to stone. His wife and children, too, fell
under the wrath of Anítan. The following morning the whole family had
petrified up to the knees, and during the following three days the
process continued from the knees to the hips, then to the breast, and
then on to the head. And thus it is that to this day there may be seen
on Bináoi Peak the petrified forms of Añgó and his family.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>Limes and lemons, it will be remembered, are supposed to
be objects of fear to the evil spirits.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX</h3>
<h3>THE GREAT RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT OF 1908-1910</h3>

<a name="4T1"></a>
<h4>THE EXTENT OF THE MOVEMENT</h4>
</center>

<p>The religious revival of 1908 to 1910 began, according to universal
report, among the Manóbos of the Libagánon River.<sup>1</sup> It was
thence propagated eastward till it extended over the whole region that
lies south of the eighth parallel of north latitude and east of the
Libagánon and Tágum Rivers. If the rumors that it spread among the
Manóbos of the upper Paláñgi, among the Subánuns, and among the Atás be
true (and the probability is that it is so), then this great movement
affected one-third of the island of Mindanáo, exclusive of that part
occupied by Moros<sup>2</sup> and Bisáyas. I am acquainted with some
Bisáyas who, moved by the extent and intensity of the movement on the
upper Agsúan[sic], became adherents.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>The Libagánon River is the western influent of the Tágum
River, which empties into the northern part of the gulf of Davao.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>I am informed by Capt. L. E. Case, P.O., deputy-governor
of Davao, that the Moros of Máti took a zealous part in the movement. It
is then not improbable that the Moros of the gulf of Davao participated
in it likewise.</p>

<p>Among the Christianized and non-Christianized Manóbos, Mandáyas,
Mañgguáñgans, and Debabáons I know of only a few men and of not a single
woman or child old enough to walk who did not take part in it.</p>

<p>Upon my arrival in Compostela I was told about this religious
revival, but to make myself better informed I went to the settlement of
the one who had introduced the movement into the Agúsan Valley. The
following is his story, corroborated since that time in every detail by
unimpeachable evidence.</p>

<center>
<a name="4T2"></a>
<h4>REPORTED ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE REVIVAL</h4>
</center>

<p>One Meskínan,<sup>3</sup> a Manóbo of the Libagánon River, was taken
sick with what appeared to be cholera. He was abandoned by his
relatives. On the third day, however, he recovered and went in search of
his fugitive people. Naturally his appearance caused consternation, but
he allayed the fears of his fellow tribesmen by assuring them that his
return was not due to the influence of any evil spirit but to that of a
beneficent spirit, who, he asserted, had presented him with a medicine
which he showed them. They readily gave credence to his story in view of
his marvelous recovery, and also because of the extraordinary state of
trembling and of apparent divine possession into which he fell after
recounting his story. Accounts of this event spread far and wide, until
it reached the Mawab River,<sup>4</sup> but in so altered a form that it
not only attributed to Meskínan an ordinary priesthood but declared that
he had actually been transformed into a deity, and that as such he could
impart himself to all whom he might desire to honor. The chief of the
Mansáka group of Mandáyas on the Mawab sent an urgent message to
relatives of his near Compostela. My informant was one of these, and he
described to me the midnight exodus of the whole settlement on its way
to Mawab. The following is substantially his account.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Meskínan is the religious pseudonym of Mapákla, a Manóbo
of the Libagánon River.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>A tributary of the Híjo River which empties into the gulf
of Davao.</p>

<p>Upon their arrival at Mawab the most powerful chief on the river laid
before them the messages that had been received from Libagánon; how
Meskínan had been changed into a deity and had ceased to perform the
natural functions of eating and drinking. On the following day a
messenger arrived at Mawab settlement, purporting to come directly from
Meskínan. He stated that Meskínan had announced the destruction of the
world after one moon. The old tribal deities would cease to lend their
assistance to those that garbed themselves in black.<sup>5</sup> In the
intervening time he (Meskínan) would direct men how to save themselves
from destruction.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>My informant interpreted this as meaning
non-Christianized people. This reference to dark-colored dress is not
clear.</p>

<p>My informant said that the following orders were issued by
Meskínan:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) All chickens and pigs were to be killed at once; otherwise they
would devour their owners.</p>

<p>(2) No more crops were to be planted.</p>

<p>(3) A good building for religious purposes was to be erected in each
settlement.</p>

<p>(4) In each settlement there was to be one priest<sup>6</sup> who
must have received his power from Meskínan himself, and several
assistants<sup>7</sup> who were to help to propagate the news and to
perform the prescribed services in distant &#34;churches.&#34;</p>

<p>(5) The services were to consist of praying to Meskínan, performing
sacred dances in his honor, and <i>forwarding offerings to him</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup>6</sup>Called <i>pun-ó-an</i>.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup><i>Tai-tái-an</i>, that is, &#34;bridges,&#34; meaning
probably that these emissaries were to be the bridge over which the
religious doctrines would pass in spreading from settlement to
settlement.</p>

<p>My informant described to me how several people of Máwab settlement
went over the Libagánon for the purpose of ascertaining the truth of the
numerous messages and of the ceaseless rumors. On their return they
reported that Meskínan was truly a deity; that his body was all golden;
that he ate only the fragrance of offerings made to him; and that he
bestowed his special protection on those alone who made these offerings.
The visitors to Libagánon brought the news that the toppling
over<sup>8</sup> of the world would take place within one moon, and that
the orders of Meskínan, the Magbabáya, should be carried out at once,
for otherwise, when the day of destruction arrived, all would be
irretrievably lost; husband would be separated from wife, and mother
from child; pigs and chickens would prey upon whomsoever they could
catch, and all would live a life of darkness and despair. But those who
had complied with instructions would be saved; their bodies, at the
moment of the fall of the world, would become golden and they would fly
around in the air with never a care for material wants, <i>the men on
their shields, and the women on their combs</i>.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup><i>Kíliñg</i>.</p>

<p>A high priest from the Tágum River conferred a
&#34;<i>Magbabáya</i>&#34;<sup>9</sup> or spirit upon my informant and
upon several others who were to act as his assistants and emissaries.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>As the narration proceeds an attempt will be made to
explain this term.</p>

<p>The people who had assembled at Máwab settlement decided accordingly
to erect an immense house for the performance of the religious acts
enjoined by the Magbabáya of Libagánon. In this edifice they passed one
month in expectation of the impending cataclysm. Men, women, and
children, half starving as my informant assured me, danced and sang to
the sound of drum and gong, while he and his assistants broke out at
intervals into supplications to the Magbabáya of Libagánon and fell into
the state of violent exaltation that was the outward manifestation of
the fact that a spirit had taken possession of them.</p>

<center>
<a name="4T3"></a>
<h4>SPREAD OF THE MOVEMENT</h4>
</center>

<p>Toward the end of the month word was received from Meskínan that the
end of the world would not take place for three more moons in order that
every settlement might have an opportunity of erecting its religious
house and of saving itself thereby from the impending doom. The priests
and their assistants were bidden to spread the news far and wide, even
in the most inaccessible haunts of the land.</p>

<p>My informant and his relatives then returned to their settlement on
the Báklug River, but only to find that their pigs and chickens had been
stolen by Christianized people of Compostela. They constructed a
religious house of very fine appearance and faithfully fulfilled all the
other behests of the Magbabáya.</p>

<p>All this time reports and messages as to the approach of the end of
the world kept pouring into Compostela from Libagánon, so that it was
not long before my informant was invited to establish a religious house
in Compostela. As this town is the principal intertribal trading point
to which Christianized Manóbos, Mañgguáñgans, and Mandáyas resort, it is
evident that within a short time word of the approaching calamity was
received and believed by all the surrounding peoples, and my informant,
the high priest, was invited to establish &#34;churches&#34; in all the
settlements of Mandáyaland. Through the instrumentality of other priests
and their assistants the movement spread among the Debabáons of the
Sálug country, among the Mañgguáñgans of the Mánat and Sálug districts
and among the Manóbos of the upper Agúsan, the Baóbo, the Ihawán, and
the Simúlau Rivers.</p>

<p>This great religious movement was known as
&#34;Túñgud.&#34;<sup>10</sup></p>

<p><sup>10</sup>I am unable to give any suggestion as to the meaning of
this word, nor have I been able to find anyone, from high priests down,
who pretended to know its meaning.</p>

<center>
<a name="4T4"></a>
<h4>ITS EXTERIOR CHARACTER AND GENERAL FEATURES</h4>
</center>

<p>When I arrived on the upper Agúsan the movement was in full swing,
and I had every opportunity to hear the messages and rumors from
Libagánon and to watch the proceedings of the high priests and of their
assistants. I was handicapped by my inability to follow the language
used in the sacred songs and supplications, but I had many of them
interpreted to me. With this exception the following statements as to
the character of the movement are first hand.</p>

<p>The first and most tangible feature of the revival was the lack of
food. No rice nor taro had been planted because of the Magbabáya's
injunction, so that the whole population of the upper Agúsan and of the
Mandáya country had been compelled to subsist for the months preceding
my arrival on the taro that had already been planted and on the
<i>camote</i> crop. Hence on my arrival rice was so scarce that it cost
me three days' wandering, no little amount of begging, and a good round
sum of money to procure a supply sufficient for my own needs. The
scarcity or utter lack of food was further made evident by the fact that
on several occasions I had to leave settlements because I was unable to
get food.</p>

<p>When in their homes the people showed fear at all hours, but
especially during the night. The falling of a tree in the forest, the
rumbling of thunder, an earthquake, an untoward report from Libagánon,
and similar things would draw from them the repetition, in low fearful
tones, of the mystic word &#34;túñgud&#34; and would send them off in a
hurry to the religious house. In Compostela the people vehemently denied
to the visiting Catholic missionary their adherence to the new movement,
but as he was leaving the town an earthquake occurred and the words
&#34;<i>túñgud, túñgud</i>,&#34; broke from the lips of one of the most
influential men in the town.</p>

<p>Another and very noticeable feature of the movement, indicative of
its profound influence, upon these people, was the cessation of all
feuds and quarrels. After all that has been said on the subject of
Manóbos in general and their social institution of revenge in
particular, one can readily realize and greatly marvel at the paramount
influence exerted by the great revival of those two years. Bisáyas and
others more or less conversant with Manóbo ways and character were
amazed at the wonderful effect which this religious movement exerted on
these peoples, one and all. From tribe to tribe, from settlement to
settlement, from enemy to enemy, traveled priests, assistants,
everybody. Mañgguáñgans, who seldom or never visited Compostela, might
be found performing their religious services there. Some of them even
went so far as to penetrate into the almost inaccessible haunts of the
upper Manorígao Mandáyas, the hereditary and truculent enemies of
Compostela whom even the Catholic missionaries could never convert.
Debabáons from the Sálug-Libagánon region went fearlessly over to the
Karága, Kasaúman, and Manái districts and returned unscathed. Many a
time in Compostela and other places I heard it remarked concerning a
particular individual that, were it not for the order of the Magbabáya
of Libagánon to refrain from quarrels and to forego revenge, he would be
killed.</p>

<p>So great then was the sway of this religious movement that the
natural law of vengeance yielded to it and its adherents almost starved
themselves for it.</p>

<h4>THE PRINCIPAL TENETS OF THE MOVEMENT</h4>

<a name="4T51"></a>
<h5>NEW ORDER OF DEITIES</h5>
</center>

<p>In the first place the spirit that received a particular individual
under his tutelary protection was either a new divinity communicable to
others or one of a new class of divinities. I incline to the latter
interpretation as being more in accordance with general Manóbo religious
ideas. In either case the old order of deities was relegated to an
inferior position, and no further worship was paid to them. The
Magbabáya, whether one or more, had come, according to all the
statements of Meskínan, to announce the dissolution of the world or at
least of that part of the world inhabited by those who dressed in
black--that is, pagan peoples--and to teach men to save themselves from
a future life of darkness and desolation.</p>

<p>After his deification Meskínan acquired the power to impart himself
to such as he deemed worthy, if they presented themselves to him. They
were said, after being thus endowed, to have a <i>Magbabáya</i>, in much
the same way as we speak of a person having got the spirit. Upon further
development of the movement certain individuals acquired the power of
imparting their spirit to others, but a spirit bestowed personally by
Meskínan was considered to be of greater potency than that granted by
others.</p>

<center>
<a name="4T52"></a>
<h5>OBSERVANCES PRESCRIBED BY THE FOUNDER</h5>
</center>

<p>The means prescribed by Meskínan through his priests and emissaries
for escaping from the consequences of the approaching demolition
were:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) The construction of well-made and clean religious
buildings<sup>11</sup> in each settlement.</p>

<p>(2) The frequent worship of him in these buildings by dance and chant
under the direction of local priests or of their assistants.</p>

<p>(3) The material offerings of worldly goods to these same
officiants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup>11</sup><i>Ka-má-lig</i>.</p>

<p>That these injunctions were carried out faithfully and in the most
remote regions I can personally testify. All through the mountainous
Mandáya country (Kati'il, Manorígao, Karága, and the very sources of the
Agúsan) I found the same religious structures, the same class of priests
and faithful congregations. As I learned in my last trip in 1911 up the
Karága, the Christianized Mandáyas of the coast towns in the
municipalities of Karága, Bagáñga, and Kati'il had joined the movement.
From Bagáñga to the point on the Libagánon that was the cradle of the
movement is a linear distance of some 120 kilometers, and it takes under
very favorable conditions at least seven days of continuous travel over
unspeakable trails to communicate from one point to the other. Yet the
religious movement spread from Libagánon to Bagáñga and to more distant
points in an incredibly short time.</p>

<p>As a further proof of the fidelity with which the observances were
carried out, let me say that I frequently dropped into settlements only
to find the houses practically empty and the inhabitants all assembled
in the religious house. While passing along the trails I could hear on
all sides the roll of drums from the distant almost inaccessible
settlements as the settlers danced in honor of their unseen gods. Upon
my arrival probably the first words that greeted me would be
&#34;Túñgud, túñgud.&#34;<sup>12</sup> In some places, as on the central
Kati'il, I could not open my mouth to speak without hearing the women
and children utter at once these strange words. Perhaps it was their
idea that my conversation might bring about the consummation that they
feared so much.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>Besides this there was another mystic word equally
unintelligible, <i>ta-gá-an</i>.</p>

<p>In many places I was not allowed to enter the religious buildings,
being assured that the new local deity might be displeased, but in such
places as I was permitted to enter I noticed the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) A small alcove<sup>13</sup> in one corner, frequently provided
with a door, sometimes of the folding type. The purpose of this alcove
was to serve as a sanctuary solely for the priests and for their
assistants. Within they were supposed to hold closer communion with
their deities, while the worshipers chanted and danced outside. As the
story of the movement proceeds, the real purpose of this alcove or stall
will be explained.</p>

<p>(2) An altar consisting of a shelf supported on two legs and having
on it offerings of bolos, daggers, lances, and necklaces, together with
a supply of drink.</p>

<p>(3) A drum and gong, a mat or two for dancing, and a hearth made out
of four logs set upon the floor.</p>

<p>(4) Eight or more rudely carved posts supporting the house. Along the
walls small carved pieces of wood intended for ornamentation.</p>

<p>(5) Great cleanliness under and in the immediate vicinity of the
building. In Compostela the devout worshipers actually carried sand from
the river and spread it on the ground around the building. Flowers, a
variety of wild begonia, I think, were planted around some of the
buildings. Such actions as these showed the zeal with which the movement
inspired them, for in the regulation of their homes such ornamentation
is unprecedented.</p>

<p>(6) An offering stand close to the building. On this were placed
offerings of betel nut and drink, which were deemed acceptable to the
deities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup>13</sup>Called <i>sin-á-buñg</i>.</p>

<center>
<a name="4T6"></a>
<h4>RELIGIOUS RITES</h4>
</center>

<p>Several rites, such as that of the conferring of a Magbabáya, I was
unable to witness, because up to the time of my departure from the upper
Agúsan they were not usually performed there, but nearly always over on
the Libagánon, Tágum, or Mawab Rivers. The investment of priests and
emissaries with Magbabáya spirits did take place a few times in
Compostela, but I was not permitted to attend, the assigned reason being
that my presence might be displeasing to these deities. The ordinary
religious performance, however, in honor of Meskínan I witnessed
repeatedly, and will now describe a typical one.</p>

<p>The ceremony was performed at a settlement on the central Kati'il.
The high priest and his assistants were my guide and carriers who had
taken advantage of my trip to earn a little and at the same time to
spread the new religion.</p>

<p>Upon our approach to the settlement one of the assistant priests went
ahead to announce our arrival. The first building we reached was the
religious house. Before ascending the notched pole that served for a
stairs the high priest gave a grand wave of his arm and asked in a loud
voice: &#34;Art thou here already, perchance?&#34; In answer I heard a
distinct whistle proceeding, as I thought, from the building. The priest
went on: &#34;When dids't thou get here?&#34; This was answered by
several low whistling sounds which the priest interpreted to mean
&#34;early this morning.&#34; The dialogue was continued in a similar
strain for several minutes, the responses always being in the form of
low prolonged whistling or low sharp chirps, and always proceeding, as
it seemed to me, from the building, though to others the sound appeared
to come from the opposite direction or from the sky, so they said. I
questioned the priest and he pointed his hand in a diametrically
opposite direction to that from which the sounds appeared to me to
come.</p>

<p>When we went up into the building we found nearly the whole
settlement assembled. The high priest gave the latest report from
Libagánon, which was to the effect that Meskínan had determined not to
overthrow the world for three months more in order to give the
settlements that had not yet joined the movement an opportunity to do so
and thereby to save themselves. The high priest went on to tell the
listeners how the Magbabáya of Libagánon had departed to the underworld
and had taken up his abode near the pillars of the earth; how he had
been engaged in weaving a piece of cloth and had only 1 yard to finish,
upon the completion of which the world would be destroyed. After having
convinced the audience of the necessity of making known these
particulars to neighboring clans and of complying with the orders of
Meskínan, he announced the request of Meskínan that a certain number of
lances be donated from each settlement. When he had concluded his
narration, which was substantiated by his assistants, it was proposed by
the assembled people that he perform the <i>túñgud</i> services,
whereupon he and his assistants danced and chanted for about an hour,
the tenor of the chants being, according to the interpretation given to
me, the latest doings and orders of the great Magbabáya of Libagánon.</p>

<p>The following morning it was decided to hold a sacrifice in honor of
Meskínan, so the chief of the settlement with great difficulty procured
a pig. All being ready and the pig being in position on the sacrificial
table with the usual fronds, the ceremony began. Even while vesting
himself in a woman's skirt, according to the customs adopted in the
performance of the religious dance, the high priest manifested signs of
the influence of his Magbabáya, for he trembled noticeably. One feature
of the dance was different from those of the ordinary religious dance in
that the priest carried a small shield in one hand and a dagger in the
other, though he did not make any pretense of performing the dagger
dance as described in a previous part of this monograph.<sup>14</sup>
The use of this shield was enjoined as part of the new ritual and was
intended to remind the congregation that faithful male followers would
be saved by means of their shields when the world toppled over.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>It may be noted here that the Mandáya dance is neither
so graceful nor so impressive as the Manóbo dance. The feet move faster
and there are fewer flexings of the body and no mimetic movements, so
characteristic of the Manóbo dance. Neither is a woman's skirt worn nor
are handkerchiefs carried in the hands.</p>

<p>The high priest danced only about two minutes, because his spirit
came upon him, and he fell down upon one knee, unable to rise. I never
saw a more gruesome spectacle. A bright unnatural light gleamed in his
eyes, his countenance became livid, the eyeballs protruded, a copious
perspiration streamed from his body, the muscles of his face twitched,
and his whole frame shook more and more vehemently as the intensity of
the paroxysm increased. Fearing an utter collapse, I assisted him to his
feet and left him resting against the wall.</p>

<p>As soon as the high priest fell under the spell of his spirit, one of
the assistants broke forth into a loud chant, which ever and anon he
interrupted with a loud coughlike sound followed by the words,
&#34;<i>túñgud, túñgud, tagáan</i>.&#34; This chant, as well as the
subsequent ones, was taken up by several of the assistants successively
and, according to the interpretation furnished me, dealt with the
wondrous doings of Meskínan in the underworld and described in detail
the end of the world as announced by Meskínan. In succession each of the
priests, including the local ones, danced and fell under the influence
of their deities, but not with such vehemence as the high priest whose
spirit was declared to be &#34;very big.&#34;</p>

<p>An important point to be noted in the dance was the removal by the
dancer at some part of the dance of his sacred headdress,<sup>15</sup>
the emblem of his new priesthood. This was a kerchief which was supposed
to have been given personally by Meskínan to everyone upon whom he had
conferred a <i>Magbabáya</i>. Removing his handkerchief the priest waved
it over the heads of the congregation and finally over or near any
object that he desired. This was an intimation that such object became
consecrated and thereby the property of the great Magbabáya of
Libagánon. A refusal to surrender it was tantamount to perdition when
the end should come. Such was the doctrine universally preached and as
uniformly believed and practiced.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup><i>Mo-sá</i>.</p>

<p>Continuing the ceremony, the high priest made several efforts to
dance, but always with the same result. He chanted, however, frequently,
but always made use of many words that had been taught him by his spirit
and which were unintelligible to my interpreters.</p>

<p>After about two hours we all left the religious building and took up
our positions around the sacrificial table, the priests in the center.
Those whose spears, daggers, bracelets, and other property had been
consecrated by the waving of a priest's headdress now deposited them
under or near the table.</p>

<p>The high priest was the principal officiant, but was assisted by his
fellow priests from the Agúsan and by the new local priests. None of the
priests of the old religion took any part, the old gods being supposed
to have yielded to the new Magbabáya.</p>

<p>The only divergences from the usual ceremonial proceedings on the
occasion of a sacrifice were the placing of the sacred headdresses over
the victim and the omission of omen taking, blood libation, and blood
drinking. The pig was killed by plunging a dagger through its left side,
the blood was caught in a pan, and the meat was consumed in a subsequent
feast in which the priests did not participate, not being permitted,
they said, by their respective deities.</p>

<p>The scene that followed the killing of the pig was indescribable. The
priests covered their heads and faces with their sacred kerchiefs and
trembled with intense vehemence, some leaning against the posts of the
sacrificial table, the high priest himself groveling on the ground on
all fours, unable to arise from sheer exhaustion. When the death-blow
had been dealt to the victim they broke into the mystic words,
&#34;<i>túñgud, túñgud, tagáan</i>,&#34; with loud coughs at the end.
These words were taken up by the bystanders and shouted with vehemence.
Many of them, especially the small girls, fell into paroxysms of
trembling. Many of the men and adult women divested themselves of their
property, such as necklaces, bracelets, and arms, and laid them near the
sacrificial table. Others promised to make an offering as soon as they
could procure one.</p>

<a name="4T7"></a>
<h4>THE REAL NATURE OF THE MOVEMENT AND MEANS USED TO CARRY ON THE
FRAUD</h4>
</center>

<p>I can state unqualifiedly that the whole movement carried on in the
Agúsan Valley among the Mandáyas, Debabáons, and Mañgguáñgans of the
Sálug-Libagánon region was a fraud from beginning to end. I state this
on the testimony of the high priest who introduced it into the Agúsan
Valley, on that of the other priests, and on my own discovery of the
fraud. The abandonment of the movement and the open avowal of the
Mandáyas of the Karága, Manorígao, Bagáñga, Mánai, and Kasáuman Rivers,
who are still bemoaning the loss of many valuables that they had given
as offerings, is unimpeachable evidence that the whole movement was a
great religious deception.</p>

<p>I have no reason for doubting the wonderful recovery of Meskínan,
whose real name was Mapákla, nor do I see any improbability in the
report that he fell suddenly under the influence of a spirit, for such
an occurrence is not without precedent in Manóboland. I will admit even
that at the beginning belief in the revival was sincere, but as time
went on and the reputation of the power of Meskínan's spirit became
greater, abuses crept in, so that shortly after my arrival in Compostela
the whole system became an atrocious deception for the purpose of
wheedling innocent believers out of their valuables.</p>

<p>The scheme was most probably engineered by some Mandáyas of the Tágum
River in league with one of the men of the Mawab River and two of the
upper Sálug. The Mandáyas of the Tágum River have had dealings with
Moros from time immemorial, and undoubtedly they learned from them much
craft and chicanery. It is far from being impossible that they were
prompted by Moros in the present case or that Moros themselves set the
movement afoot. I have one reason for being inclined to adopt the latter
opinion, namely, that the Moros did actually originate a movement of
this kind in the seventeenth century as stated by Combes in his
&#34;Historia de Mindanáo,&#34; and a similar movement about the year
1877, as is mentioned in one of the Cartas de los PP. de la Compañía de
Jesús.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the various artifices by which the fraud was
carried out.</p>

<center>
<a name="4T71"></a>
<h5>THE SACRED TRAFFIC</h5>
</center>

<p>Meskínan lived somewhere up the Libagánon River, far from the Tágum,
and was therefore practically out of communication with the Agúsan.
Hence there was little danger of discovery in reporting him deified and
his body all golden. After his deification he was always absent, either
&#34;down at the pillars of the earth&#34; or on an &#34;island at the
sea&#34; or winging his way &#34;on a shield through the starry
region.&#34; It is easy to understand how difficult it would be to
secure an interview with him under these circumstances.</p>

<p>As soon as it was reported from the Tágum and Máwab Rivers that
Meskínan could take anyone under his special protection--in other words,
that he could bestow his spirit upon others--several went over to Tágum
and Mawab and did actually receive a spirit, but only at the hands of
those who purported to be the representative of Meskínan. Now those who
received this spiritual influence were expected to give a
consideration<sup>6</sup> for the gift, or <i>Magbabáya</i>, as it was
called. As time went on this usage developed into the custom of paying
the equivalent of a slave (P30) for every <i>Magbabáya</i> received from
the representatives of Meskínan. This payment had to be made not only
for the original bestowal of these spirits but also in case of their
flight and return, for they were of a fugitive disposition. I have seen
several young fellows start off for Libagánon in fear and trembling to
redeem their runaway spirits. It may be noted here that the flight of a
spirit was ascribed to some act on the part of its possessor that
provoked its displeasure. Thus one young fellow assured me that his
<i>Magbabáya</i> had fled because of his failure to abstain from eating
rice.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>Called <i>á-lo</i>. Perhaps this is an abbreviated form
of the Spanish word <i>regalo</i>, which means gift, and which is a word
of frequent use among those with whom the Catholic missionaries came in
contact.</p>

<p>I have seen Mandáyas of the Kati'il River, men of influence and of
renown, travel over to the Mawab--a wearisome journey of some four
days--loaded down with lances, bolos, daggers, slaves, and other
chattels, with which to purchase a <i>Magbabáya</i>. I saw them return,
too, happy in the possession of their newly acquired spirits but worse
off in a worldly way.</p>

<p>But the religious traffic was not confined to the sale of
<i>Magbabáya</i> alone. Wooden images and sacred handkerchiefs, supposed
to proceed from Meskínan, were sold at very profitable rates, as were
also religious shields, and various other objects. Thus on one occasion
I made a present to a high priest of several yards of cloth. My
astonishment may be imagined when I discovered that he had cut it up
into handkerchiefs which he had disposed of far down the Kati'il River
for the equivalent of 5 pesos apiece, assuring the purchasers that they
had been made and consecrated by the great <i>Magbabáya</i> of
Libagánon, and that they were of the utmost efficacy in case of
sickness, and above all on the day of dissolution. I asked my friend,
the high priest, why he dared to perpetrate such a fraud on his fellow
tribesmen. He said that the Mawab and Tágum people had fooled him out of
all his possessions and that he was taking this means to get back the
equivalent.</p>

<p>A chief from the upper Sálug sold a wooden religious image for the
value of P15 on the Bahaían River. He asserted that it was presented to
him by Meskínan as a marvelous cure for all the ills of life. I was
present in the house of this selfsame chief and high priest while he was
whittling out similar ones.</p>

<p>During my recent trip to the Manorígao River I was shown kerchiefs of
khaki that had been sold by a highpriest of Compostela about two years
before. The indignation and threats of the owners were terrible when I
explained to them that I had traded the khaki for some Mandáya skirt
cloth. One cunning individual made a feint at throwing the
responsibility on me, but happily I was able to evade the liability.</p>

<center>
<a name="4T72"></a>
<h5>RELIGIOUS TOURS</h5>
</center>

<p>In order that the pious fraud might be carried out more effectively
and with less risk to the missionaries of it, it was proclaimed at the
beginning that all feuds should cease and that all quarrels were
tabooed. This permitted intercourse between former enemies and enabled
the priests and their assistants to travel unmolested from settlement to
settlement. Together with an injunction that prohibited any controversy
as to the truth of the movement or of any of its tenets, under penalty
of failing to participate in its ultimate advantages, the proscription
of feuds and quarrels insured personal safety to all who might desire to
visit other settlements.</p>

<p>To provide a lodging for the great number of priests and others who
would presumably visit settlements outside of their own, the originators
of the fraud decided and proclaimed that religious structures should be
erected in every settlement. It was thought, probably, that the erection
of these would give greater eclat to the affair and thereby tend to
bring about a general and more ready adherence to the movement.</p>

<p>As a safeguard against the discovery of the fraud, it was taboo to
dispute or to express doubts about any detail of the doctrines, even the
most minute. As a further precaution against the suspicions of doubting
Thomases, great care was exerted in the selection of priests and of
their assistants. In nearly every case the persons selected were active,
popular, and, apparently at least, guileless young men. I myself was
shocked on discovering to what length these young fellows, in all other
respects attractive and popular, went in their propagation of the fraud
and of their insidious utilization of its benefits.</p>

<p>They traveled from settlement to settlement, bearing the latest
reports about Meskínan; how he had failed to come to an agreement with
the ancient deities, how he was wandering around in the starry regions;
how he had assistants who were forging chains of steel with which to
pull up the religious building in the hour of the earth's doom. After
convincing their listeners of the gravity of the situation and of the
necessity for renewed efforts, they would dance, chant, tremble,
prophesy, shake their sacred kerchief at or over some desired object,
receive a harvest of donations, and go on their way rejoicing with the
sacred booty in their possession.</p>

<p>An idea of the magnitude of the pious offerings sometimes made may be
gained from the following list of articles received by a high priest
from the upper Sálug during a religious tour from the Agúsan to the
Manorígao, Karága, Mánai, and Kasaúman districts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 old English muzzle-loaders.</p>

<p>100 ornamental silver breastplates.</p>

<p>300 old Spanish and Mexican pesos.</p>

<p>60 pieces of Mandáya skirt cloth.</p>

<p>9 pigs (not including those that had been sacrificed in the course of
the tour).</p>

<p>30 various other objects, such as suits of clothes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I estimate the cash value of the above to be, more or less, 1,000
pesos, an amount with which the priest could have purchased 33 slaves or
5 of the most costly maids in his tribe.</p>

<p>The case of a high priest who was under old financial obligations to
me is another instance of the extent of the sacred traffic. Upon my
arrival I advised him of my purpose and told him to get ready to settle
his debt. Though he had absolutely no property at the time, he assured
me that he could pay as much as a thousand pesos, so he started out for
a trip among the Mandáyas of Manorígao and within a few weeks received
enough pious offerings wherewith to pay his debt.</p>

<center>
<a name="4T73"></a>
<h5>THE WHISTLING SCHEME</h5>
</center>

<p>The greatest deception of all was the whistling scheme. This was
carried on usually at night, because it was distinctly against the
spirit of the movement to call upon one's <i>Magbabáya</i> for an answer
except at nighttime and in the absence of a bright light, unless the
<i>Magbabáya</i> of the priest or priests present first intimated his
desire to speak.</p>

<p>The method of audible communication between the priest and his
familiar deity was very simple. The priest called out in his ordinary
voice, &#34;<i>Magbabáya</i>.&#34; If the deity was present, and had not
gone off on some errand of his own, or had not run away, he answered by
a long, low whistle. The interrogating priest then went on to consult
the deity about the matter which he had in view, whether the end of the
world was nigh, whether the prospective trip would be dangerous, or
whether a boar hunt would be successful. The deity answered by a number
of whistles, intelligible to the priest only, and long or short
according to the amount of information supposed to be conveyed.</p>

<p>That this procedure was fraud I need not say. I investigated the
matter personally and found that the whistling was done either by the
priest himself or by a colleague of the priest. Thus in Kati'il, where I
first heard it, I slyly looked into the alcove whence the sound
proceeded and descried[sic] one of my companions, an assistant of the
priest, squeezed into one corner with his hand over his mouth for the
purpose of disguising the direction of the sound.</p>

<p>Upon the first favorable opportunity I quietly upbraided my
companion, the high priest, for his complicity, but he merely conjured
me not to reveal it to anyone else lest he and his companions be
killed.</p>

<p>On another occasion I heard a high priest question his divinity as to
the amount of a fine to be imposed and distinctly heard 15 low chirps
proceeding from the supposed <i>Magbabáya</i> in answer. The priest
interpreted this to signify 15 pesos. As the priest continued to consult
his familiar on various subjects, I proceeded to investigate and saw a
young friend of mine seated in a hammock, his head bent down and his
hand placed at his mouth in an effort to divert the direction of the
sound. I was within a few feet of this young fellow and could plainly
see by the light of the kitchen fire the attitude of the impersonator
and distinctly hear his whistling. The seance continued for some 10
minutes, the impersonator chirping out answers to the questioning
priest. The listeners were fully convinced that the sounds were of
divine origin and expressed that conviction by uttering some such
expressions as, &#34;Oh what a beautiful voice the Magbabáya has,&#34;
&#34;Túñgud, Túñgud,&#34; &#34;Oh, he is up on the roof now!&#34; As it
is often difficult to determine the direction whence a sound comes, the
people would sometimes dispute as to where the god was, one maintaining,
for example, that he was above the house, while another maintained that
he was below it. Of course such matters were referred to the priest, who
always knew the exact location of the imaginary god.</p>

<p>Some priests made use of small bamboo contrivances and some used
their little hawk bells to produce the voice of their spirits. In one
case the use of a small jingle bell elicited expressions of great
admiration for the softness and sweetness of the supposed deity's voice.
&#34;Oh, what a melodious voice,&#34; one would say, while another would
respond, &#34;Yes; it is like a tiny flute.&#34;</p>

<p>Seances of this kind were of constant occurrence and yielded the
priest a harvest of donations. Those who desired to acquire definite
knowledge concerning any subject of importance had to ask a priest to
consult his deity, and after the consultation they were expected to make
a suitable offering. I once called upon a priest to find out for me the
name of the individual who had stolen my scissors. The deity did not
respond at the first call, for the reason that, as the priest informed
me, he had gone on a trip to Libagánon, so we postponed the consultation
in order to afford him time to recall the absent divinity. I can not say
what means he was supposed to have taken to bring about the return of
the spirit, but the extra service cost me a trifle more. Not long after,
when the fire did not cast such a glare and the light had been
extinguished, there was a fairly audible chirp proceeding, as all those
present said, from the <i>camote</i> clearing. &#34;Ah! he is here,&#34;
they all said. The priest then accosted the deity in this manner:
&#34;Why dids't thou delay, Magbabáya?&#34; and then went on to find out
the name of the stealer of my scissors. The supposed deity, however,
would not reveal the actual name lest I should quarrel with the
individual--a proceeding that would be in violation of a current
taboo--but he vouchsafed me the information that it was a female that
was guilty. As it turned out subsequently the supposed divinity erred on
this point, so as a matter of policy I claimed the restitution of what I
had paid the priest for the consultation.</p>

<center>
<a name="4T74"></a>
<h5>PRETENDED CHASTITY AND AUSTERITY</h5>
</center>

<p>Chastity and austerity also were means calculated to promote faith in
the sincerity of the priest, and consequently in the truth of their
assertions and divine interpretations. The abstention from sexual
intercourse was strictly enjoined on all who had received a
<i>Magbabáya</i>, and observance of the restriction was rigid
apparently. The priests and their wives slept in the religious building,
but did not cohabit, the men sleeping in one place and the women in
another. But, as I was told by one high priest before my departure that
he had observed the injunction only in appearance, I am inclined to
think that the same was true of all the other priests.</p>

<p>Abstinence from food was also enjoined by the decrees of the great
<i>Magbabáya</i> of Libagánon. Hence priests pretended to abstain from
all food when in their own settlements but during their religious tours
ate and drank on the plea that the spirits had forbidden them to
abstain, as such abstinence might cause offense because of the laws of
hospitality, which require a visitor not to refuse the bounty of his
host. The customs as to abstinence were not uniform. One priest
maintained that his deity required from him total abstinence while he
was in his own settlement. Another asserted that only partial abstinence
was required of him, as, for example, from rice, or from chicken, or
from drink, and he observed the rule rigidly. Total abstinence, however,
was only a pretense. I had occasion to verify this fact in the case of a
priest who maintained emphatically that he had not eaten a morsel for
three whole days. I went to his house and found him eating inside the
mosquito-bar. Of course I was fined for my curiosity.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the withdrawal of the ancient tribal divinities and
the substitution for them of the new-fangled ones at a time of such
common peril was well calculated to arouse the inherent religious
fanaticism and fear of these primitive peoples. Let us review the
principal points of the creed. The ancient deities had abandoned the
world in disgust and decreed its downfall. The great <i>Magbabáya</i> of
Libagánon had gone down to the pillars of the world and was prepared to
shake the earth to its very foundations until it toppled over. He and
the spirits with whom he communicated were powerful deities, able and
disposed to rescue their worshipers not only in the awful moment of
dissolution when the earth would become a vast charnel house full of
darkness and desolation, but also in all the concerns of life up to the
very end.</p>

<p>These new-fangled spirits were endowed with marvelous powers. They
could resuscitate the dead, restore the sick to health, discern the
future, impart invulnerability and other wondrous qualities, and in the
moment of final dissolution rescue their faithful worshipers from the
irrevocable vengeance of the ancient tribal divinities. Many and many a
Manóbo told me, when I suggested to him the possibility of error or of
deception in the whole system, that it was better to be sure than sorry,
and that it was well worth the loss of the worldly goods to be sure of
securing immunity from the threatened danger. Who would not be afraid
when even the mighty <i>Magbabáya</i> of Libagánon would at times demand
a lance from every settlement and keep careful watch? When many of them
began to discover the fraud they were ashamed to confess their credulity
and fanaticism, and so, seeing a good opportunity to recover their
pecuniary losses, joined in the fraud and deliberately swindled others
out of their temporal goods.</p>

<center>
<a name="4T8"></a>
<h4>THE END OF THE MOVEMENT</h4>
</center>

<p>The beginning of the end came about December, 1910. The various
inconsistencies in the reports from Libagánon, the continual
postponement by Meskínan of the end for one flimsy reason or another,
the discovery by individuals of lies and fraudulent conduct on the part
of the priests, the hunger and misery consequent upon the abandonment of
the crops, the constant advice on the part of Bisáyas and others, and
the ever-increasing scarcity of valuables that might be given as
offerings to the priests and to their assistants--all these contributed
to bring about the termination of a religious swindle that victimized at
least 50,000 people.</p>

<p>It is evident that when the time announced for the dissolution
approached some reason for its failure to take place would have to be
patched up and propagated. Thus in the beginning the catastrophe was to
take place after one moon, but Meskínan made a long journey for the
purpose of interceding with the old tribal gods and succeeded in getting
a prorogation of three moons. Toward the end of the three moons,
Meskínan decided to wait for one more before putting into execution the
fatal decree. And so things went on from moon to moon. Now the end would
be postponed because Meskínan had to finish a mystic piece of cloth on a
loom near the pillars of the world. Then it would not take place because
he had hied him to an &#34;island of the sea.&#34; And thus things
continued until people began to weary of the suspense and to suspect the
fraud.</p>

<p>At the time of my departure from the upper Agúsan the whole country
was getting into a turmoil. The Mandáyas, enraged at the loss of their
property bootlessly bestowed on the priest, threatened to make an attack
upon the people of the Agúsan. The Manóbos announced their intention of
raiding the Debabáons. The Mañgguáñgans menaced the Tágum Mandáyas. In a
word trouble was so imminent that had it not been for the establishment
of government on the upper Agúsan to protect the Christianized peoples
already settled in towns, probably there would have been much
bloodshed.</p>

<center>
<a name="4T9"></a>
<h4>SIMILAR MOVEMENTS IN FORMER YEARS</h4>
</center>

<p>In the &#34;Cartas de los PP. de la Compañía de Jesús&#34; I find
similar movements reported. One is reported in a letter of Father
Pastells of May 2, 1877, and the other in some other letter, the date
and writer of which I am unable to cite. The general features were the
same, that is, the appearance of a person, in one case a woman, in
another a child, with body all golden, who announced the destruction of
the world. Crops were not to be planted, domestic animals were to be
killed, and all were to await in prayer and fasting the consummation.
The object of these frauds was to make the Christian conquest of the
upper Agúsan peoples impossible.</p>

<p>On my trip to the upper Karága a venerable old Mandáya informed me
that in his youth there had been a similar fraud which was engineered by
the Moros of Súmlug, on the east side of the gulf of Davao, and that
when the Mandáyas of Karága discovered the fraud they made a raid on the
authors of it and killed many.</p>

<p>I also find mention of a similar movement in a letter from Father
Urios,<sup>17</sup> dated Jativa, July 26, 1899. It seems that one
Manáitai, a Manóbo chief, residing at the headwaters of the Bahaían
River, was told by his familiar spirit, Sindatúan, to lead all the
Manóbos of Patrocinio back to the mountains. By orders of Sindatúan the
whole clan was to meet in one house and for the space of one moon they
were to unite in prayers and shouts, at the end of which time all would
be transported, body and soul, into the sky.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>Cartas de los PP. de la Compañía de Jesús, 9; 533,
1891.</p>

<p>The letter states that Manáitai was obliged to abstain from
everything except roots, sugar-cane, and fish. The worshipers of
Sindatúan complied with directions in every particular, even to the
burning of candles; but as there was no immediate prospect of a
celestial assent, the belief was abandoned and the parties concerned
returned to their original creed and observances.</p>

<p>From these examples it does not seem too bold to state that religious
revivals of a similar character may be looked for periodically, perhaps
every 10 or 15 years, especially on the occurrence of public perils such
as contagious diseases or fear of invasion.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX</h3>

<a name="51"></a>
<h4>HISTORICAL REFERENCES TO THE MANÓBOS OF EASTERN MINDANÁO</h4>

<a name="511"></a>
<h5>EARLY HISTORY UP TO 1875</h5>
</center>

<p>From 1521 until 1877 Manóbo history is for the most part veiled in
the obscurity of traditional accounts of the past. Now and then it is
brightened by the transient light of a missionary's pen only to relapse
into the unfathomable darkness of the past. The few traditions that come
down to us in Manóbo legendary song and oral tradition furnish but
little light in the darkness, arid that little is probably not the pure
and simple light of truth, but the multicolored rays of the popular
imagination that have transformed warriors into giants and enemies into
hideous monsters. Thus Dábao, of whom mention will be made presently,
was a giant according to the general tradition. The Moros that invaded
the Agúsan are spoken of as &#34;tailed men.&#34; There is, however, one
tradition--persistent and universal--to the effect that up to 1877, and
even later, though in a lesser degree, there was war--ruthless,
relentless, never-ending war. This tradition is borne out by the events
that succeeded the advent of the missionaries and their efforts to
thrust Christianity upon a people who neither understood its doctrines
nor relished its rigorous precepts.</p>

<center>
<h5>1521</h5>
</center>

<p>Mention of the Agúsan River and of Butuán is found in the writings of
various historians, notably of Father Francisco Combes<sup>1</sup> who
states that Magellan landed in Butuán in 1521. It is believed by various
historians that the first mass in the Philippine Islands was celebrated
here, and that the planting of a cross on a small promontory at the
mouth of the Agúsan River was intended by Magellan as a formal
occupation of the Philippine Islands in the name of Spain.<sup>2</sup> A
later governor, to commemorate this event, erected a monument which
stands to this day near the mouth of the Agúsan River.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Historia de Mindanáo y Jolo (Madrid, 1897), 76.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>It is strange that Pigafetta who records the doings of
Magellan with such marvelous minuteness, does not mention this first
mass.</p>

<center>
<h5>1565-1574</h5>
</center>

<p>A letter from Andrés Mirandola to Philip II<sup>3</sup> some time
after the arrival of Legaspi in 1565 states that Mirandola was ordered
to explore the islands of Magindanáo and to seek a port called Butuán.
Upon arrival in that town he made friends with the chief. He found Moros
trading at the port. He describes the people as being of a warlike
character. In another letter of Mirandola,<sup>4</sup> dated 1574, we
find Butuán spoken of as a district with much gold.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>E. H. Blair and J. A. Robertson, The Philippine Islands,
34: 202, 1906.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>Ibid., 3: 233.</p>

<center>
<h5>1591</h5>
</center>

<p>In various letters and other documents translated by Blair and
Robertson from original sources we learn that the district of Butuán was
an <i>encomienda</i><sup>5</sup> and that tributes were collected as
early as 1591.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>An <i>encomienda</i> was a royal allotment or grant of
land, including the natives that lived thereon, to a Spaniard for the
purpose of government.</p>

<center>
<h5>1596</h5>
</center>

<p>In Chirino's<sup>6</sup> relation it is set forth that in 1596 the
Jesuits, Valero de Ledesma and Manuel Martinez, began their missionary
labors in the Agúsan Valley where they found the inhabitants &#34;by no
means tractable on account of their fierce and violent nature.&#34;
Christianity, however, made surprising advances, so great that the
principal chief of the district, Siloñgan, divorced five of his wives,
and protected the missionaries in every way possible.<sup>7</sup>
Religious fervor is said to have reached such a height that the people
publicly flagellated themselves until the blood flowed.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>Ibid., 12: 315.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Ibid., 13: 47, et seq. It is interesting to note here
that Ledesma in one of his letters mentions the fact that the Ternatans
were accustomed to swoop down on the coast of Mindanáo and kept the
natives of Mindanáo on the alert. In citations from other writers quoted
by Blair and Robertson we find evidence of dealings of the Ternatans,
both friendly and unfriendly, and with the natives of Mindanáo.</p>

<p>Ledesma and Martinez were succeeded by other Jesuit missionaries who
preached the doctrine to the Hadgaguanes,<sup>8</sup> &#34;a people
untamed and ferocious--to the Manóbos and to other neighboring
peoples.&#34;<sup>9</sup></p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Perhaps the Hadgaguánes here referred to are the
Higagáons or Banuáons of the present day.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>Ibid., 44: 60.</p>

<p>There must have been opposition to the propagation of Christianity as
we find that a fort was constructed in Línao<sup>10</sup> some time
after 1596. The headman, however, of the Línao region invited one Father
Francisco Vicente to visit his people and it seems that &#34;even the
blacks<sup>11</sup> visited him and gave him hopes of their
conversion.&#34;<sup>12</sup></p>

<p><sup>10</sup>Línao was a town situated some miles to the south of
Veruéla. It and the surrounding country subsided in recent times. Its
former site is now under a maze of mad torrents that carry the waters
from the upper to the middle Agúsan.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup>We should bear in mind that Spanish historians
frequently referred to the mountain people as <i>little blacks</i>
(Negrillos), otherwise we might be led to believe that the ancestors of
the present people living in the vicinity of the old townsite of Línao
were Negritos.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>Ibid., 44: 60, et seq.</p>

<p>Morga in his Sucesos<sup>13</sup> speaks of Butuán as being
peaceable. He makes mention of the industry of obtaining civet from the
civet cats.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>Ibid., 15.</p>

<center>
<h5>1597</h5>
</center>

<p>In the General History of the Discalced Augustinian Fathers, by Fray
Andres de San Nicolas,<sup>14</sup> we learn that missionaries had
penetrated the district of Butuán as early as 1597, but that they had
been unable to withstand the hostility of the mountain people.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>Ibid., 21.</p>

<center>
<h5>1622</h5>
</center>

<p>In 1622 the Recollects succeeded the Jesuits in ecclesiastical
administration of Butuán district. Father Jacinto de Fulgencio seems to
have been the most energetic of the band of eight that undertook the
conquest, for it is related<sup>15</sup> that he traveled 50 leagues up
the river, preaching the faith to the villages. &#34;He had serious and
frequent difficulties in making himself heard,&#34; polygamy and slavery
being the two great obstacles to the reception of the Christian
doctrines. The results, however, were successful, for he is said to have
converted 3,000 souls, and to have founded three
<i>conventos</i><sup>16</sup> one of which was in the village of
Línao.<sup>17</sup> At this period Butuán is said to have had 1,500
Christians, and Línao, or Laylaía as it was also called, 1,600 souls.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>Ibid., 21: 221.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>A convento is a building erected for the accommodation
of the spiritual administrators of a town and their assistants.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>Ibid., 21: 221.</p>

<center>
<h5>1629</h5>
</center>

<p>In 1629<sup>18</sup> there was a general uprising of the Súlus and of
the Karágas. One Balíntos arrived in Butuán with letters from the famous
Corralát, decreeing the death of all the missionaries and urging the
people of Butuán to rebel, but they, &#34;with a faithfulness that has
ever been a characteristic of them,&#34; refused to follow the orders of
Corralát, and instead of killing the missionaries, protected them by
every means in their power.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>Ibid., 35: 65.</p>

<center>
<h5>1648</h5>
</center>

<p>The arrival of the Dutch in Manila<sup>19</sup> in 1648 incited the
natives to sedition. A decree, issued by the Governor of Manila, Don
Diego Faxardo, helped to foment the restlessness into rebellion. Santa
Teresa<sup>20</sup> sets forth some of the results of the rebellion
among the Manóbos.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>Ibid., 36: 126.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>Historia de los religiosos descalzos, translated by
Blair and Robertson (36: 128, et seq.).</p>

<p>He says that there were certain wild Indians in the mountains of
Butuán in the Province of Karága.<sup>21</sup> &#34;They had kinky hair,
oblique eyes, a treacherous disposition, brutish customs, and lived by
the hunt.<sup>22</sup> They had no king to govern them nor houses to
shelter them. Their clothing was just sufficient to cover the shame of
their bodies, and they slept wherever night overtook them. They were
pagans, and in their manner of life almost irrational. They were warlike
and waged an incessant war with the coast people.&#34; Santa Teresa
describes how Dábao, a Manóbo chieftain of great strength and sagacity
and undoubtedly the original of the legendary giant that still lives in
Manóbo tradition, stirred up rebellion and succeeded in killing many
Spaniards in Línao.<sup>23</sup></p>

<p><sup>21</sup>The Province of Karága at this time extended from
Dapítan on the northwest of Mindanáo to Karága on the southeast.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>The reference to the possession of kinky hair might lead
us to think that the ancestors of the present Manóbos were Negritos. The
only trace of curly hair among the Manóbos of the Agúsan Valley is
observed among those who occupy the northwestern parts of the valley,
and northeastern contiguous to Butuán.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>Santa Teresa says that a poisoned arrow pierced the leg
of a soldier. This reference to the use of poisoned arrows, taken in
consideration with Santa Teresa's description of the Manóbos of that
region as being kinky haired, and living by the hunt, seem to indicate
that the Manóbos of those days were Negritos. A further evidence is
added by the application of the term <i>Negrillos</i> (little Negroes)
to Manóbos. The use of poisoned arrows is, to this day, a distinctly
Negrito custom. At the present time the use of poisoned arrows is
unknown to Manóbos and, as far as I have been able to learn, no
tradition as to the former employment of them exists.</p>

<p>The rebellion extended all over the valley and Fray Augustin and
other churchmen lost their lives as a result. It was finally suppressed
by the capture of innumerable slaves. &#34;Manila and its environments
were full of slaves.&#34; &#34;The Butuán chiefs, who were the mirror of
fidelity, suffered processes, exiles, and imprisonments; and although
they were able to win back honor, it was after all their property had
been lost.&#34;<sup>24</sup> In 1651 peace was restored by the return of
the innumerable slaves captured by the Spanish forces.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup>Blair and Robertson, 36: 134.</p>

<center>
<h5>1661-1672</h5>
</center>

<p>Between the years 1661 and 1672 the Recollects pursued their
evangelical labors in the Agúsan Valley, notwithstanding the constant
opposition of the Manóbos. Father Pedro de San Francisco de Asis
describes the natives as being &#34;robust and very numerous.&#34; He
says that in time of peace they were tractable, docile, and reasonable,
had regular villages, lived in human society, were superior to the
surrounding mountain people, and were easily converted. He claims that
there were 4,000 converts living between Butuán and Línao. The people to
whom he refers are most probably the ancestors of the Bisáyas of the
present day, because, as we shall see later on, the Christianized Manóbo
towns of the present day did not exist before 1877.</p>

<p>Father Combes<sup>25</sup> is the authority for the statement that
Butuán was the origin of &#34;the rulers and nobility of all the islands
of Jolo and Basilan.&#34; The following is the extract:</p>

<p><sup>25</sup>Ibid., 40: 126.</p>

<p>But the rulers and nobility of all the islands of Jolo and Basilan
recognize as the place of their origin the village of Butuán (which,
although it is located in this island, is within the pale of the Bisáyan
Nation) on the northern side, in sight of the Bóol, and but a few
leagues away from Leyte and from Bóol, islands which are in the same
stage of civilization. Therefore, that village can glory at having given
kings and nobility to these nations.<sup>26</sup></p>

<p><sup>26</sup>San Francisco in his Cronicas (see Blair and Robertson,
40: 312) says: &#34;They [the Butuáns] are the origin of the best blood
and nobility of the Basílans and Joloans, for the king of Jolo even
confessed that he was a Butuán.&#34; It is surprising to note the
dialectical similarity between Súlu and the variety of Bisáya spoken in
the Agúsan Valley. Words that are not found in any other Bisáya dialect,
are common to these two dialects. It is therefore probable that formerly
there was intercourse between the two peoples.</p>

<p>Speaking of the native peoples and their customs San
Antonio<sup>27</sup> in 1744 says that &#34;Some of the Manóbos in the
mountains of Karága (who are heathen and without number, although some
are Christians, a people civilized and well inclined to work, who have
fixed habitations and excellent houses) pay tribute.&#34;</p>

<p><sup>27</sup>Ibid., 40: 298,</p>

<p>We learn from the same authority that one of the missionaries
obtained wonderful results in the conversion of Manóbos in Línao. He was
unable to specify the number but says that it increased greatly, for up
to that time there were only 3,000 converts in the whole district of
Butuán. My authority seems to believe that there were two classes of
people around Línao, the one whom he distinctly calls
Manóbos--&#34;tractable, docile, and quite reasonable,&#34; living in
villages in human society in a very well ordered civilization--and the
other, an inferior people leading a brutish life. It is reasonable to
suppose that the people whom San Antonio refers to as Manóbos are the
ancestors of the present Bisáyas of Veruéla, Bunáwan, and Talakógon, who
have traditions as to the pagan condition of their ancestors.</p>

<p>Concepcion<sup>28</sup> gives a detailed record of the Moro raids in
Mindanáo. &#34;Butuán was laid waste and some 200 captives seized; the
little military post at Línao, up the river, alone escaped.&#34; The
tradition of the fight between the Moros and the people of Línao still
exists among the Bisáyas of the Agúsan Valley. A statue of the Virgin is
still preserved in Veruéla that is said to have been struck by a ball
from a Moro <i>lantaka</i> (small cannon). It is believed that this
unseemly accident aroused the anger of the Virgin herself, who promptly
turned the tide of battle against the Moros. The only tradition
regarding this invasion that I found extant among the Manóbos is the
legend of the tailed men, and of their own flight.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup>Ibid., 48: 163.</p>

<center>
<a name="512"></a>
<h4>FROM 1875 TO 1910</h4>

<h5>1800-1877</h5>
</center>

<p>For the nineteenth century we have few historical records of the
Manóbos until the Jesuits who had been expelled from the Philippines in
1768 and returned in 1859, resumed their work in eastern Mindanáo in
1875. The material concerning the Manóbos is contained in a series of
selected letters<sup>29</sup> from the missionaries in the field to
their provincial and higher superiors. Though containing little
ethnological data of a detailed character, they afford in their
ensemble, a vivid picture of the work of the missionaries in reducing
the pagan tribes of Mindanáo to civilization and outward Christianity.
Dates of the formation of the various town and
<i>rancherias</i><sup>30</sup> are furnished; with the names of the
chiefs, friendly and in many cases unfriendly, the opposition on the
part of the mountain people to the adoption of Christianity, and the
armed resistance on their part to its implantation, as well as the
interclan feuds, frequently with details as to the number of slain and
of captives, and the number of converts in each district are stated. In
a word, these letters form a most valuable and accurate account of the
Christian subjugation of a large portion of the pagan peoples of
Mindanáo.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup>These letters are called Cartas de los PP. de la
Compañía de Jesús de la mision de Filipinas, and were printed
consecutively in Manila from 1876 to 1902 and probably later.</p>

<p><sup>30</sup>A rancheria is a small dependent settlement of
Christianized people.</p>

<center>
<h5>1877</h5>
</center>

<p>In the Agúsan Valley the first efforts of the missionaries were
directed to the Bisáyas or old Christians, as they are called, of
Butuán, Talakógon, Veruéla, and Bunáwan. Father Bove<sup>31</sup> in
1877 writes that he reunited many Bisáyas of Híbung and Bunáwan in
Talakógon, which is at present one of the few municipalities in the
sub-Province of Butuán. He notes the extent of the slave trade between
Manóbos and Bisáyas, and that he made a preliminary trip to the upper
Agúsan and to the upper Sálug. In the same year Peruga visited Bunáwan
and organized the church among the Bisáyas of Bunáwan who had not been
annexed to Talakógon. In the meantime Urios and others rounded up the
stragglers of Butuán, Tolosa (now Kabarbarán), and Maínit.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup>Cartas de los PP. de la Compañía de Jesús, 3.</p>

<center>
<h5>1879</h5>
</center>

<p>In 1879 Urios reports the establishment of Las Nieves, Remedies,
Esperanza, Guadalupe, Maásam (now Santa Ines), and San Luis, all of
which <i>rancherias</i> of <i>conquistas</i><sup>32</sup> or
Christianized Manóbos are still in existence.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup><i>Conquista</i> is a Spanish word meaning conquest. It
is of universal use in the Agúsan Valley to denote a recently
Christianized member of a non-Christian tribe.</p>

<p>In the same year Luengo, who was in charge of the Bisáya settlement
of Talakógon, succeeded in settling the Manóbos to the south of
Talakógon in the town of Martines. These Manóbos were for the most part
from the Rivers Pudlúsan, Lábnig, and Aniláwan. He comments on the
ignorance of the Talakógon Bisáyas who came, he asserts, from the Rivers
Sulibáo and Híbung, and from the district west of Mount Magdiuáta.</p>

<p>The same year Pastells converted 771 Manóbos of the Simúlao River. He
then visited the upper Agúsan, and negotiated with the pagans of that
district--a conglomerate group of Mandáyas, Mañgguáñgans, Manóbos, and
Debabáons--for the foundation of Compostela and Gandia. He founded
Moncayo, and Jativa (pronounced Hativa), with Debabáon and Manóbo
converts, respectively.</p>

<p>Urios took up the work of Pastells on the River Simúlao and baptized
1,000 Manóbos, whom he induced to found the town of Tudela. He then
pursued his work among the Manóbos to the south of Veruéla and founded
the town of Patrocinio. He reports that for some trifling reason the
town was moved not long after. From 1905 to 1909 I know that the site of
the town was changed five times.</p>

<p>La Concepcion,<sup>33</sup> near Nasipit, San Vicente, San Ignacio,
and Tortosa were founded the same year. Urios remarks that the class of
people that he induced to settle in the last-mentioned town were
half-Negrito. The present inhabitants are known as Manóbos but a casual
glance will convince one of their Negrito derivation.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup>This rancheria is not in existence.</p>

<p>During the same year Urios founded Loreto on the Umaíam River, and
succeeded in getting the Manóbos of San Rafael to settle in Túbai. This
is interesting as the inhabitants of Túbai pass for Bisáyas at the
present day.</p>

<center>
<h5>1881-1883</h5>
</center>

<p>From 1881 to 1883 we find continuous reports of the armed opposition
of all the unconverted peoples to the adoption of Christianity, so much
so that troops had to be stationed in Esperanza and Talakógon. Guadalupe
and Amparo were abandoned, the ostensible reason being fear of Doctor
Montano who was taking anthropometrical measurements of Manóbos in the
towns through which he passed, but as Urios remarks, this was only a
pretext for withdrawing from a form of life that did not suit them.
Guadalupe was burned by the pagans shortly after its abandonment.
Several new towns had been formed, namely, Maásao, Bugábus, Óhut, Los
Remedies, and Hauilián, but the opposition of the still un-Christianized
people increased, and, as a result, all the newly formed towns on the
lower and middle Agúsan, except La Paz, Loreto, and the Simúlao towns,
were abandoned. One reason assigned for this was the fear entertained by
the inhabitants that revenge might be taken on them for the murder of
certain Butuán Bisáyas who had been killed by the <i>conquistas</i> of
Esperanza. However, there is little doubt but that the real reason for
the abandonment was the fear on the part of the newly Christianized
people toward their mountain congeners and relatives, for it must be
borne in mind that the newly Christianized people were the tools used by
the missionaries to reach the pagans. These <i>conquistas</i> were
prevailed upon to act as intermediaries, interpreters, guides, carriers,
and soldiers. It is obvious that their cooperation with the
missionaries, especially in armed expeditions, brought upon them the
enmity of the pagan peoples whom the missionaries intended to convert,
sometimes <i>nolens volens</i>. To avoid the ill feeling of the pagans
and the results that would follow as a consequence, the
<i>conquistas</i> preferred to flee and join the pagans, or at least to
maintain a neutral attitude.</p>

<center>
<h5>1883</h5>
</center>

<p>The desertion of all the towns on the lower Agúsan meant the return
of some 5,000 <i>conquistas</i> to their original manner of life, for at
this period the total number of converts in the valley was
11,000.<sup>34</sup> The upper Agúsan had 1,500, La Paz, 1,000, and the
Simúlao district, 2,000.</p>

<p><sup>34</sup>Ibid., 5: 71.</p>

<p>On the upper Agúsan affairs followed the same trend. The Mandáyas of
the Kati'il River killed 180 on the Húlip River. Jativa and Búal were
attacked by Mandáyas, the latter place being abandoned immediately.
Baóbo, &#34;the river of <i>bagáni</i>,&#34;<sup>35</sup> continued to
keep Patrocinio, Búai, and Gracia on the alert.</p>

<p><sup>35</sup>A <i>bagáni</i> is a Mandáya, Mañgguáñgan, Debabáon, or
Manóbo warrior who has a certain number of deaths to his account and who
gives evidence of being under the influence of war deities.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these vicissitudes, the missionaries succeeded in
establishing Pilar, a Mañgguáñgan town, on the Mánat. It is described as
being made up of the most ignorant and depraved people on the upper
Agúsan. In the same year (1883) Gracia was founded between Patrocinio
and Jativa. This town is not now in existence, and I am unable to state
just where its location was, unless it may have been near the present
site of Langkiláan. On the lower Agúsan, Gángub, or Nuevo Guadalupe, and
Tortosa on the Kabarbarán River were formed. Neither of them is in
existence at the present day.</p>

<p>The missionaries, not yet being able to reunite the Manóbos, directed
their activities to the conversion of Mamánuas. Hence in 1883 we read
that the Mamánua settlements of Santa Ana, San Roque, San Pablo,
Santiago, and Tortosa were formed, the total number of converts being
about 800. Most of these settlements are still in existence, though
there are times when not a soul may be found in any of them.</p>

<center>
<h5>1884</h5>
</center>

<p>In 1884 little is recorded. It was calculated that at this time there
were still 6,000 unconverted pagans in the upper Agúsan district.
Jativa, which was the headquarters of the mission, and which had a
population of 156 families, was attacked by Mandáyas. On the lower
Agúsan matters were at a standstill, the conversion of 134 Mamánuas
being the only important item that is recorded in the letters.</p>

<center>
<h5>1885</h5>
</center>

<p>On the Pacific coast the labors of the missionaries had been confined
to the Bisáyas up to 1885, in which year Peruga converted the pagan
Mandáyas of Marihátag and Kagwáit. He also ascended the Tágo River
converted the pagan Mandáyas of Alba, establishing at the same time a
town of that name.</p>

<p>Guardiet worked among the Manóbos to the west of Hinatu'an and
baptized 217 in Ginhalínan near Javier (pronounced Havier). He made his
way over to the Híbung River and founded Los Arcos with 80 converts.</p>

<p>There is no record of the work in 1885 among the Manóbos of the lower
Agúsan except that Urios founded the town of San Ignacio near Butuán. On
the upper Agúsan, however, things took a turn for the worse. Eighty
families, or a little more than half of Jativa, abandoned the town. All
the people of Gandia went out but were finally persuaded to return and
associate themselves with the people of Compostela. The Mañgguáñgans of
Clavijo (pronounced Claviho)<sup>36</sup> moved to Gandia. Not long
afterwards Compostela, Gandia, and Jativa were abandoned, the town of
Compostela having been burned on two separate occasions. The same year,
however, they were re-formed.</p>

<p><sup>36</sup>I can not state just where the town of Clavijo on the
upper Agúsan was located. Up to 1908 there was a town of the same name
on the middle Agúsan, near the mouth of the Ihawán River, but it
consisted entirely of Christianized Manóbos, and not of Mañgguáñgans
such as are stated by my authority to have been the people of Clavijo on
the upper Agúsan.</p>

<center>
<h5>1886</h5>
</center>

<p>In 1886 Moncayo and Pilar were deserted and Jativa was attacked. On
the lower Agúsan affairs remained in status quo. The Mamánua settlements
were increased by one which was located on the Dáyag River, near
Maínit.</p>

<p>In the middle Agúsan, Gracia and Concepcion were founded on the
Ihawán River.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the total number of converts in the
Agúsan Valley from 1877 to 1886 is put down at 17,840 souls, living in
42 towns.<sup>37</sup></p>

<p><sup>37</sup>Ibid., 11, appendix.</p>

<center>
<h5>1887</h5>
</center>

<p>In 1887 it became necessary to increase the number of troops in
Jativa, owing to the flight of the inhabitants of Moncayo, Compostela,
and Gandia. As a consequence of this move, these towns re-formed. San
Isidro was abandoned this same year.</p>

<center>
<h5>1887-1888</h5>
</center>

<p>On the lower Agúsan the missionaries, notably Urios, continued their
labors and succeeded in gaining over to Christianity many of the Banuáon
people of the upper hut and Libang Rivers. The year 1887-88 seems to
have been one of comparative peace except in the district to the west of
La Paz, on the Argáwan River, where it became necessary to make use of
armed troops.</p>

<center>
<h5>1889</h5>
</center>

<p>In 1889 cholera got into the Agúsan Valley. The inhabitants of
Tortosa abandoned their town. On the Pacific coast Puntas penetrated
among the Manóbos of the Tágo River above the town of Alba, and Alaix
visited the Mamánuas of Kantílan and Lanusa, among whom he made 84
converts. In the same year Peruga made more Mandáya converts in Alba on
the Tágo River.</p>

<center>
<h5>1890</h5>
</center>

<p>In 1890 Moncayo and Gandia had a feud, as a result of which the
people of the former abandoned their town. Matters progressed so
favorably on the Argáwan that Sagunto was pacified and Asuncion was
founded farther up on the same river. This town is no longer in
existence, but a small <i>rancheria</i> called Tilyérpan was founded in
1906 nearer to Sagunto. Bása on the Kasilaían River and San Isidro on
the Bahaían River were founded the same year, but, on the other hand, an
outbreak of fever led to the abandonment of Gracia and Concepcion on the
Ihawán. Many Mamánua and Mandáya converts were added to Los Arcos. The
conversion of these is attributed to the fighting that had previously
taken place in Las Navas and Borbon, on the same river. Milagros on the
Óhut was founded this same year.</p>

<center>
<h5>1891</h5>
</center>

<p>The year 1891 does not show any further special development except
the foundation of a Banuáon settlement, called Concordia, on the Líbang
River.</p>

<p>In 1892 Vigo and Borja (pronounced Borha) on the Baóbo River were
established. Manóbos of the Sibágat River were converted and a
settlement was founded at its juncture with the Wá-wa. This settlement
is now called Pait. San Miguel on the Tágo River was founded with 25
families, most of whom were Manóbos. This town is no longer in
existence. Amparo, on the other hand, was abandoned, and my authority
for this statement remarks that this was the seventh time since its
foundation that the town had been abandoned. Other towns had passed
through the same experience, though not so many times.</p>

<center>
<h5>1893</h5>
</center>

<p>In 1893 Misericordia, now no longer in existence, was reestablished
on the Bugábus River. San Estanislao, at the mouth of the Labáo River,
was founded this year. It is not in existence under this name. Santa Fe
is the present name and the settlement occupies a new site, selected in
1908, I think.</p>

<p>On the Tágo River the conversion of the Mandáyas was completed and
more Manóbos were added to the roll of Christians, thus bringing the
number of Christianized Manóbo families to 80.</p>

<p>In the Agúsan Valley, Moncayo and Milagros were abandoned.</p>

<center>
<h5>1894</h5>
</center>

<p>In 1894 Castellon was founded at the mouth of the Lángkilaan River.
At the present day no such town is in existence, though near the old
town site of Castellon there is a small rancheria called Lángkilaan.</p>

<p>During the same year Pilar, which up to this time had been on the
Mánat, was transferred to the Agúsan, between Gandia and Compostela.
Another town is said to have been founded on the Mánat River. Gerona,
between Moncayo and Gandia, Cuevas on the Bahaían, and Corinto on the
Agsábo, a branch of the Óhut, were founded during this year, and San
Isidro was re-formed.</p>

<center>
<h5>1900-1905</h5>
</center>

<p>I have been unable to peruse the letters of the missionaries from
1894 to the present day, but I was given to understand by well-informed
Bisáyas of Butuán that at the time of the Philippine insurrection in
1898 the Christianized Manóbos lived in a state of comparative
tranquillity. During the time of the revolution few outbreaks are
recorded, notwithstanding the fact that the missionaries had abandoned
their upriver parishes and the Spanish troops had been withdrawn. From
1900 to 1905 affairs on the lower and middle Agúsan, excepting along the
upper Kasilaían, Argáwan and Umaíam, were very peaceful, a fact that was
due to the enthusiasm with which the Christianized Manóbos devoted
themselves to the culture of <i>abaká</i> and to the production of its
fiber. On the upper Kasilaían, Argáwan and Umaíam, Ihawán, and Baóbo
there occurred occasional killings and the country was always in a
condition of alarm.</p>

<p>On the upper Agúsan, especially in the region of Compostela, the old
feuds broke out and it became necessary for the government of the Moro
Province to station troops at Compostela.<sup>38</sup></p>

<p><sup>38</sup>Upon my arrival in the Agúsan Valley in 1905 I found the
following <i>rancherias</i> in existence:</p>

<p>On the main river, Butuán (a Bisáya settlement), San Vincente,
Amparo, San Mateo, Las Nieves, Esperanza, Guadalupe, Santa Ines, San
Luis, Martines, Clavijo, San Pedro, Veruéla (a Bisáya settlement),
Patrocinio, Langkiláan, Hagimítan, Tagusáb, Búai, Moncayo, Gerona,
Gandia, Pilar, Compostela, and Taga-únud.</p>

<p>On the Óhut River, Milagros and Remedies.</p>

<p>On the Wá-wa River, Vérdu.</p>

<p>On the Líbang River, Concordia.</p>

<p>On the Kasilaían River, Basa.</p>

<p>On the Híbung River, Borbon, Ebro, Prosperidad, Azpeitia, and Los
Arcos.</p>

<p>On the Súlibao River (tributary of the Híbung), Novele and
Rosario.</p>

<p>On the Argáwan River, La Paz and Sagunto.</p>

<p>On the Umaíam River, Loreto, Kandaugong.</p>

<p>On the Simúlao River, San Jose, Bunáwan (a Bisáya settlement),
Libertad, Basa, Tudela, and San Isidro.</p>

<p>On the Nábuk River, Dugmánon.</p>

<p>From 1905 to 1910 the following towns were formed:</p>

<p>Santa Fe, at the mouth of the Labáo River.</p>

<p>Pait on the Wá-wa, at the mouth of the Sibagat River.</p>

<p>Nuevo Trabajo (pronounced Trabaho), a few hours up the Maásam
River.</p>

<p>Ba'ba', on the Híbung River between Prosperidad and Azpeitia.
Tilierpan and Kamóta, above Sagunto on the Argáwan.</p>

<p>Violanta, Santo Tomas, and Wálo, on the upper Umaíam.</p>

<p>Maitum, on the river of the same name, which is a tributary of the
Híbung River.</p>

<p>Mambalíli, below Bunáwan on the Simúlao River.</p>

<p>Comparing the towns in existence at the beginning of 1910 with those
whose establishment is reported in the Jesuit letters we find that the
following towns have ceased to exist:</p>

<p>Tolosa, some few hours up the Kabarbarán River.</p>

<p>Tortosa, on a river to the west of the present Máasao.</p>

<p>San Ignacio, a little to the south of Butuán.</p>

<p>Concepcion, near the town of Nasípit.</p>

<p>San Rafael (I do not know the location of this town, but I am under
the impression that it was located near Túbai).</p>

<p>Nuevo Guadalupe, near the present Guadalupe.</p>

<p>Misericordia, about 12 miles up the Bugábus River.</p>

<p>Hauwilián, at the mouth of the Hauwilián River.</p>

<p>San Estanislao, at the mouth of the Labáu River.</p>

<p>Patai, between Martires and Borbon.</p>

<p>Basa, on the Kasiliágan River.</p>

<p>Las Navas, on the Híbung.</p>

<p>Asuncion, on the Argáwan River.</p>

<p>Clavijo, on the Agúsan near the mouth of the Ihawán River,</p>

<p>Gracia and Concepcion, on the Ihawán River.</p>

<p>Bigo and Borja, on the Baóbo River.</p>

<p>Castellon, Gracia, Clavijo, and Jativa, on the upper Agúsan</p>

<p>San Miguel, on the Tágo River (Pacific coast).</p>

<p>The number of converts from the pagan peoples in the Agúsan Valley up
to 1898 must have reached 25,000, divided as follows: Mamánuas, 1,000;
Banuáons and the branch of Manóbos occupying the northeastern part of
the valley, 3,000; Mandáyas, 2,000; Mañgguáñgans, 1,000; Debabáons,
1,000; Manóbos, 17,000. These came finally to live in some 50 towns,
including the unstable settlements of Mamánuas. From 1898 until the
present time the conversion of pagans in the Agúsan Valley has been
insignificant.</p>

<h4>METHODS ADOPTED BY THE MISSIONARIES IN THE CHRISTIANIZATION OF THE
MANÓBOS</h4>
</center>

<p>The methods adopted by the missionaries in the conversion of the
pagans in Mindanáo are made clear in a report by Father Juan Ricart, S.
J., to the Governor General of the Philippine Islands.<sup>39</sup> The
following extracts are pertinent:</p>

<p><sup>39</sup>Ibid., 11, appendix.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first thing that the missionaries seek to attain before
penetrating the territory occupied by these pagans is a knowledge of the
various races or tribes dwelling therein, of their customs and
superstitions, of their feuds and wars, who are their enemies and their
allies, respectively, the names of the principal chiefs, their traits of
character, and finally their particular dialect as far as it may be
possible to acquire it. Then they dispatch selected and trustworthy
emissaries, preferably inhabitants of the Christian towns who have
commercial dealings with the pagans, bidding them announce the intended
visit of the missionary. On the appointed day, the missionary, armed
with meekness and condescension, presents himself, speaking to them with
dignity and authority. He tells them that he is their friend, that he
wishes them well, that he has known of such-and-such misfortunes that
have befallen them, and that in pity he comes to succor them. He invokes
the name of the king and of the governor of the district, whose power
they had learned to fear and respect through their dealings with the
Christians. He reminds them of some wrong that either they or their
neighbors had committed on the Christians, for it is seldom that they
are not guilty of some fault or other, and intimates to them that it is
the intention of the governor to send soldiers to punish them for their
conduct. He (the missionary), however, has interceded with the governor
on their behalf and has received a promise from him that he will not
only pardon their fault but that he will take them under his protection
and defend them against their enemies. He (the missionary) goes on to
explain the advantages of civilized life, and the mildness of Spanish
rule, as far as their limited understanding can grasp. He undoes their
suspicions, forestalls their misgivings, and overcomes their fears; and
by means of presents and kind words, especially to the little ones, he
strives to soften their hearts. These interviews and lengthy discussions
are repeated as often as it is opportune or necessary, every effort
being made in the meanwhile to convince and gain over the chiefs and
elders, a result that will be attained all the more quickly if he
succeeds in settling their differences, in bringing about peace with
some more redoubtable enemy, or in helping them in the attainment of any
proper object that they may have in view. All this does not take place
without great long-suffering and bitterness on the part of the
missionary. Having decided on a site that is to their own liking and
even according to their superstitions, though sometimes it be not best
adapted for the purpose, a day is selected for the clearing, a
plaza<sup>40</sup> and streets are plotted out, and then the erection of
the tribunal and of the private dwellings begins.</p>

<p>It is at this period that the constancy and firmness of the
missionary is taxed, for he has to overcome the unspeakable sluggishness
of the uncivilized people, and to defeat the futile and continuous
pretexts that they invent for the purpose of desisting from the work and
of returning to the obscurity of the forest. It is helpful to be able to
provide sufficient alimentation for them for a few days at least, so
that it will not be necessary for them to return to the mountains in
search of food. At the same time it is expedient to give them little
rewards to induce them to begin their plantations near the new town by
planting <i>camotes</i> and other crops which yield quickly.</p>

<p>The appointment of officers for the government of the settlement is
the next step and must be conducted in a most solemn manner, it being
sometimes necessary to increase the number of jobs in order to satisfy
the ambition of the chiefs and of the elders. The chosen ones are
presented with the official staff of command in the name of the
governor, and with the traditional jacket. Thus the new town is
established. It is placed under the rule and guardianship of the
Gobernadorcillo<sup>41</sup> of the nearest Christian town, for the
purpose of bringing about compliance with the orders that emanate from
the chief of the province.</p>

<p>The missionary maintains his power and influence through an
inspector, who is usually a person of trust and worth among the older
Christians, and through two teachers, preferably a married couple
selected from among the best families. These then take up their
residence in the new town and begin their teaching.</p>

<p>As soon as the new settlement gives evidence of stability and
perseverance, an effort is made to have the governor of the district
visit it in order that the newly converted Christians may lay aside
their fear, gain new courage, and learn to become devoted to the
government.</p>

<p>The presence of an armed force upon suitable occasions is also
calculated to have some effect at this early period, as it serves to
keep quiet the dissatisfied and grumbling ones, of whom there are always
some, as well as to infuse a feeling of fear into outside enemies who
might be inclined to trouble the settlement, either because they do not
regard it in an auspicious light or because they wish to satisfy a
desire for revenge which they have harbored for a long time. Up to this
time these unhappy people (the pagans) have had no other law than the
caprice of their chiefs, nor other justice than oppression by the
strong, nor other customs than an amorphous mass of practices that are
at once repulsive and opposed to the natural law. Their guides and their
teachers have been augurs or visionary women who, in connivance with the
chief, sometimes make them abandon the territory in which they live for
fear of some invisible deity, sometimes make them launch themselves on
neighboring peolpe[sic] in order to avenge some supposed grievance, or
sometimes induce them to sacrifice a slave to appease the anger of their
gods. While such influences are paramount, there can be no firmness nor
possible security for the new settlement; on the day least expected it
will be found deserted and even burned. On the other hand, it becomes
necessary to give these people, recently denizens of the forest, a
simple code that contains the principal duties of man, that sets forth
the relation of one to another, that teaches subjects to obey their
superiors, the strong to protect the weak, and parents to teach their
children, and that enjoins upon all work and mutual respect.</p>

<p>It is also necessary to satisfy the innate desire, if we may so
speak, for a cult, that natural feeling for a religion which these
people, like all others, have. It is necessary to substitute for their
barbarous and inhuman practices others that may lift them up and revive
their drooping and pusillanimous spirits. It is necessary that in the
town there should be something to attract and to hold them with
irresistible charm. In a word, the faith must be preached to them and
they must be baptized; a religion and a church are necessary. Until a
great part of the inhabitants of a new settlement have been baptized,
until the feast of the patron saint and other religious ceremonies have
been solemnly celebrated, it is useless to hope for the stability of the
new town. The Catholic religion is a simple and powerful means for
transforming those savages into good Spanish subjects; it is the mold
wherein they leave their barbarous practices and shape themselves
perfectly unto ours.</p>

<p>The missionaries do not speak of baptism nor of religion till they
have gained the good will of the pagans, until they realize that they
are being listened to willingly and that they (the pagans) put trust in
their words. When they begin to like the Spaniards, and to hold in
esteem their customs and ideas, then the missionaries gently insinuate
themselves and begin to teach them the truths of our holy faith and to
show them the observances and rites of our religion. At the beginning
some sick person or other is baptized: afterwards, when there is some
prospect of stability, the children, and finally the adults, provided
that they have been instructed as much as their capacity and the
circumstances permit. With this prudent procedure the missionary
encounters no serious obstacle. His evangelic[sic] eloquence easily
convinces those simple people of truths so much in harmony with human
nature and of practices so much in accord with the good inclinations of
mankind. The tendency that they still retain to maintain their ancient
superstitions vanishes before the sway exerted by that superior man from
whom they have received so many favors. The greatest difficulty for them
consists in leaving the free life of the forest and in bringing
themselves to live in a settlement with its attendant restrictions; this
is especially true in the case of the chiefs and of such others as
previously had exercised any authority. But having once adopted
Christianity, baptism costs them nothing. Here and there one finds a
chief who is opposed at the beginning to being baptized because he has
several wives, but this condition, though it is not approved, is
tolerated, provided he does not trouble the others nor disturb the
settlement. But as a rule all become ashamed and repent, and end by
yielding and by following the example of the rest. The grace of God is
of transcendent power in these transformations. The savage, as long as
he continues pagan, is governed in all his acts by ancient observances
inspired by superstition and fanaticism. It is only when he has been
baptized that he understands the necessity of a change of life and
customs. Then he ceases to be Manóbo or Mandáya, in order to be a
Christian; he relinquishes his pagan name and in the course of time can
hardly be distinguished from the inhabitants of the ancient Christian
towns. Even the Mamánuas, a group of Negritos usually considered to be
recalcitrant, now live submissively and joyfully in their

<h4>THE SECRET OF MISSIONARY SUCCESS</h4>
</center>

<p>I endeavored during my tours in the interior of eastern Mindanáo to
ascertain definitely the secret of the success of the Spanish
missionaries in inducing forest-loving people to leave their ancient
homes and ways and adopt a life of dependence, political, economic, and
religious, and I have arrived at the following conclusions, based on the
information furnished me by the <i>conquistas</i>, both those who are
still living under the effective control of the Government and those who
have returned to their primitive haunts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) In a great many regions the first factor of success is the
personal equation. Some of the missionaries, notably Urios and Pastells,
must have been men of wonderfully winning ways and of deep tact, if I am
to believe my informants. In districts such as the upper Sálug, where
many of the Christianized Debabáons had retired for many years, I was
told stories of the wonderful condescension of Urios, and of his
understanding of Debabáon ways and customs. The pagans present on one
occasion assured me that if Urios were to visit them, they would all be
baptized. In other districts I heard other missionaries spoken of whose
names were so garbled that I have been unable to identify them. In most
of the districts there were kind inquiries for one or another of the
missionaries and expressions of regret that they could not see them
again.</p>

<p>(2) In other regions (upper Umaíam, upper Argáwan, and others) the
chief means used were threats of extermination, and, in cases, armed
expeditions were actually sent out to overcome opposition to the
adoption of Christianity. I base this statement on the testimony of
<i>conquistas</i> who asserted that they were acquainted with the facts,
and who went into such minute details as to lead me to believe that they
were telling the truth. How far such action is due to irresponsible and
overzealous officers leading these expeditions I am unable to say, but
the impression given me by my informants invariably was that such
expeditions were planned by the missionaries for the purpose of forcing
Christianity upon the pagans. Bisáyas were frequently in charge of
native soldiers and for commercial reasons were interested in the
conversion of the mountain people to Christianity, so that it would not
be surprising if they took unauthorized measures to effect the
Christianization of the pagans.</p>

<p>(3) The third factor of success was the distribution of presents and
alms by the missionaries. Frequent mention is made of this throughout
the Jesuit letters. It undoubtedly did a great deal toward attracting
the pagan people and convincing them of the friendship, from their point
of view, of the missionaries toward them. It has been my experience that
with a people of this stamp one present has more persuasive force than
ten thousand arguments. It opens the way to conviction more readily than
kind words and condescending manner, as it puts the tribesmen under a
feeling of obligation.</p>

<p>(4) The fourth factor was the general policy adopted by the
missionaries of posing as mediators between the Government and the
pagans. This, coupled with a previous general knowledge of the
conditions of the country, and of the customs and language of the
people, and accompanied by a dignified but condescending and genial
manner, enabled the missionaries to ingratiate themselves at once into
the favor of the people they were visiting.</p>

<p>(5) The next and last factor in the conversion of the pagan peoples
was the religious character of the men who undertook it. Religion
appeals strongly to all primitive people and especially to the peoples
of eastern Mindanáo, in which, as will be seen in the fourth part of
this monograph, there seems to occur periodically a religious movement
that for the time being subverts the ancient religious beliefs. It is
natural then, that the pomp and glitter of Catholic ceremonial appealed
strongly to the Manóbo. I can not say, from my observation, that he
became a very devout worshiper in his new faith. In fact, I know that
the average Christianized Manóbo understands little, and practices less,
of the Catholic doctrines. In so far, however, as the imposition of the
doctrine was a means to an end, namely, to radicate[sic] him in selected
centers where he fell within social and governmental control, it can not
be criticized. On the other hand, the effect of the change was, I am
inclined strongly to believe for the worse, for he lost that spirit of
manliness and independence that is a characteristic of the pagan, and he
became a prey to the more Christianized people within whose sphere of
influence and exploitation he fell. I have always been struck by the
differences, moral, economic, and even physical, between the
debt-ridden, cringing <i>conquistas</i>, and his manly, free,
independent, vigorous pagan compeer. One-half of the <i>conquista's</i>
time is consumed in contracting debts to the Bisáya trader, and the
other half in paying them. His rice is sold before it is harvested. His
<i>abaká</i> patch often is mortgaged before the planting is completed.
He is an economic serf to an inconsiderate taskmaster.<sup>42</sup></p>

It corresponds to &#34;mayor&#34; at the present time.</p>

<p><sup>42</sup>The special government established in the subprovince of
Butuán took immediate steps toward ameliorating the condition of the
<i>conquistas</i> by opening trading posts on the lower and middle
Agúsan, so that the above observations refer to the period preceding the
formation of the special government.</p>

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
